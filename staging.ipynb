      "For your trip to Tokyo, I suggest starting with a visit to the iconic **Senso-ji Temple** in Asakusa. This historic temple is Tokyo's oldest and is surrounded by traditional shops and street food vendors along Nakamise Street. It's a fantastic way to experience Tokyo's rich history and culture, and you can also absorb the lively atmosphere of the area. Don't forget to try some local snacks like sweet melon bread or ningyo-yaki while you explore!\n"

It offers all of the amazing features of Vizcom you need to get started, but you are limited to one Editor role, one Admin role, and one Team.\\n\\nThe Starter plan is limited to only two paid seats, either Admin or Editor. If you have more user roles than this prior to downgrading, we will downgrade the excess role types to Viewers. The Admin that requests the downgrade will remain an Admin. Admins can always change the roles of their Workspace members in their Workspace settings page.\\n\\nThe Starter and Professional plans are limited to one Team. If you downgrade from our Organization plan, all Teams besides your All-Workspace team will be archived. You will have view-only access to the files and folders in these archived teams. You will not be able to create new files in any teams other than the default All-Workspace team. You can move the location of your files from one Team to another at any point, as you see fit.\\n\\nSee our FAQ section for specific questions regarding content ownership and licensing when downgrading.\"\n",

This year at Milan Design Week, we put that belief into action by launching a global challenge with Decibel: reimagine the future of furniture through the lens of Vizcom and industrial design. Designers from around the world used Vizcom to develop their visions for the next generation of chairs and we took the winning concepts from 2D to full-scale reality, brought to life with robotic 3D printing and unveiled on the world’s biggest design stage.\",\n",
    "                \"submission_summary\": \"We received more than 200 submissions from designers across the globe. Each one brought fresh perspectives and pushed the boundaries of form, function, and fabrication. The creativity was undeniable. But for our jury, the real challenge was selecting concepts that not only stood out visually but could also be brought to life at full scale using Decibel's advanced additive manufacturing process.\",\n",

    "                    \"description\": \"Lou is a 3D-printed rocking chair developed by designer Brett Akop. Created in Vizcom and shaped by a nonplanar printing toolpath, Lou redefines what’s possible when digital ideation meets advanced fabrication. Brett used the tool to quickly explore silhouette, proportions, and form, allowing him to move fluidly between hand-drawn ideas and rendered visualizations. The chair’s flowing geometry was shaped with both intent and experimentation in mind, made possible by the fast iteration cycle Vizcom enables. The design takes full advantage of a nonplanar printing path, allowing the surface to curve smoothly in three dimensions without traditional layering. This approach eliminates the rigid, stepped look often associated with 3D printing, producing a tactile, seamless flow that mirrors the elegance of the original sketch. By designing directly for fabrication, Brett embraced the material behavior and constraints of robotic extrusion. The chair’s cantilevered sides, nested curvature, and single-piece construction are all intentional moves made early in Vizcom and carried through to the final print. The result is a piece that feels both sculptural and functional—a design made for the future, from the very first line.\"\n",
