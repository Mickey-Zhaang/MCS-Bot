It's one of the busiest pedestrian intersections in the world and offers a vibrant atmosphere that embodies the spirit of Tokyo. You can explore the surrounding area, check out the Hachiko statue, and enjoy shopping at nearby stores or grab a meal at one of the many restaurants. Be sure to experience the view from a nearby cafÃ© or the Shibuya Sky observation deck for a breathtaking perspective of the city!\n"

Admins can always change the roles of their Workspace members in their Workspace settings page.\\n\\nThe Starter and Professional plans are limited to one Team. If you downgrade from our Organization plan, all Teams besides your All-Workspace team will be archived. You will have view-only access to the files and folders in these archived teams. You will not be able to create new files in any teams other than the default All-Workspace team.
