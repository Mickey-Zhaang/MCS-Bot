Higher influence gives more weight to your sketch's exact form, while lower influence allows your prompt to have more interpretation on the final result.\n\n**Understanding this relationship is crucial:** the same prompt applied to different sketches will yield different results, and different prompts applied to the same sketch will produce varied outcomes.\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PlCRWm6pYmWBhoLyAvTzDTQ.png)\n\n[‹ Prompts as design intent](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/prompts-as-design-intent)\n\n[Structure of effective prompts ›](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/structure-of-effective-prompts)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=fynNNibs0&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'ogDescription': 'Vizcom turns your sketches into stunning concept drawings in seconds.

Like the transition (and extension!) from pencil to digital tablets, Vizcom offers new capabilities requiring fundamental design expertise. The most successful Vizcom users understand that it amplifies their vision rather than generates it.\n\nA designer with strong fundamentals who effectively leverages Vizcom will often outperform a skilled designer without AI tools or someone relying solely on AI without design knowledge.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JzF64KWeM5nb3eoq3rdFeSy0Aw.png)\n\n[Sketch with intent ›](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/sketch-with-intent)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=G5ibZ3fZH&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'title': 'Vizcom as a tool - Vizcom', 'og:description': 'Vizcom turns your sketches into stunning concept drawings in seconds.

Refer to the examples below for guidance.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WCvEPOCj2znB1Fyjg3Bf9bNAppg.png)\n\n1. Create a YouTube Tutorial\n\n\nCreate a 3-minute tutorial showcasing one key Vizcom feature. Refer to the example video below for guidance on tone and structure.\n\n**Your video must follow these technical requirements:**\n\n- **Resolution:** 1080p\n\n- **Audio:** Clear, with no background noise or music\n\n- **Tagging:** Include the hashtag **#VizcomAmbassador** in your post\n\n\n![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/m3V1Xg8kXbI/maxresdefault.webp)[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/m3V1Xg8kXbI?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=0)\n\n2\\. Create a Social Media Post\n\nNext, create a social media post using either your LinkedIn or Instagram account. Be sure to follow the outlined guidelines and review the example posts for reference. You only need to post on one platform.\n\n**Instagram Story**\n\nHere’s an example of what your Instagram story could look like—we hope it inspires your own creation.\n\n![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lHIe6qB2U-8/maxresdefault.webp)[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHIe6qB2U-8?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=0)\n\n**Instagram Post**\n\nAlternatively, you may choose to upload an Instagram post instead of a story. Here’s an example that illustrates the expectations for a Vizcom Student Ambassador post.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B3hn2vIn6Tl8GB0oE2n3I2BXMoE.png)\n\n**2.1 LinkedIn Post**\n\nHere’s an example of a LinkedIn post. Be sure to keep your tone professional and include the hashtag **#VizcomEDU!**\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kZud8bqkT3BBz2MMfEsj0PpiCNI.png)\n\n# Module 1  Introduction\n\n## In Module 1, you’ll **create and submit a Vizcom Workbench project**. We’ve included a few examples to help guide you. Once your project is submitted, you’ll receive instructions for moving on to Module 2.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UTncqgjweixOmdAUzuBcE6CFcBY.jpg)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=f3BOA5OgN&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:card': 'summary_large_image', 'twitter:title': 'Vizcom EDU: Empowering Designers, Educators, and Students in Our Community', 'og:title': 'Vizcom EDU: Empowering Designers, Educators, and Students in Our Community', 'ogTitle': 'Vizcom EDU: Empowering Designers, Educators, and Students in Our Community', 'og:type': 'website', 'description': 'Join the Vizcom EDU Community.

Unlike general AI image generators that create images from text alone, Vizcom's prompts work in conjunction with your sketch to create a refined visual output.\n\n> **A prompt might look like this:**\n\n`Modern office chair, ergonomic design, brushed aluminum frame, black mesh fabric, product photography, studio lighting, white background, photorealistic rendering`\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wNsNYTBTJR8qgw7AFDGhR7TUwKU.jpg)\n\nThis tells Vizcom what you're designing `an office chair`, its style `modern, ergonomic`, materials `brushed aluminum frame, black mesh fabric`, and how it should be rendered `product photography, studio lighting, white background, photorealistic rendering`.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\n\n### Here is another example:\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/tq7pZUzzvhmpUgeN24KNE7I.png)\n\nThe image above was created with the prompt:\n\n`hyperrealistic:1.5), silver, modern, electric supercar, Car design concept, (depth of field:1.5), blurred background (dark studio scene:1.8), glowing light blue taillight, monochrome scene, glossy, reflective surfaces, colorful particles flying around, DSLR `\n\nNotice that this prompt loosely follows a structure: `**[subject], [prepositional details], [setting], [meta modifiers];**`\n\n**\\\\* Tip:** consider including a brand name in your design to help establish a strong and cohesive design language.\n\n[‹ Vizcom in your workflow](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/vizcom-in-your-workflow)\n\n[Prompts as design intent ›](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/prompts-as-design-intent)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=unxGsnhVz&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'twitter:image': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'ogImage': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'generator': 'Framer 5012657', 'description': 'Vizcom turns your sketches into stunning concept drawings in seconds.

We tell stories about new ideas, how they’re used, who they’re for, and why they matter. We sketch, prototype, and render not just to visualize form, but to communicate intent.\n\nWith Animate, Vizcom adds motion to that storytelling toolkit. It’s a simple way to show how your concept moves, interacts, or unfolds directly from the canvas. Whether it’s a product turning, a user entering frame, or a character shifting expression, motion gives your story another layer of clarity.\n\nIntroducing Animation in Vizcom — Watch Your Ideas Move - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Vizcom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-XOa74z1aGdZRyvRBQ6UQ?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizcom.ai%2F)\n\nVizcom\n\n11.2K subscribers\n\n[Introducing Animation in Vizcom — Watch Your Ideas Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=TLGGxx7A1-nWgnYwNTA2MjAyNQ&v=SF1LafKAxlI)\n\nVizcom\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\n1/1\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\n[Design with me #4 - Home appliances quick design process\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 3.3K views\\\\\n\\\\\n24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXFnMeC-O_w) [Design with me #3 - Car design sketch rendering and ideation process.\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 4.2K views\\\\\n\\\\\n22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlSv_3eZnWg) [Learn Vizcom in 15 minutes: A Step-by-Step Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 13K views\\\\\n\\\\\n16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QIh7QK_wkI) [Apparel workflow - how to control colours and bring life into apparel renderings\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 4.4K views\\\\\n\\\\\n20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0X5AfGfIyA) [Scott Robertson: Exploring Creative Possibilities with Palettes\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 11K views\\\\\n\\\\\n9:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CitArF8RxY) [How to quickly render your sketches and ideate in Vizcom\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 14K views\\\\\n\\\\\n5:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhScl5SO_0) [Getting started with Palettes\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 29K views\\\\\n\\\\\n6:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr5sYJCUOc8) [Vizcom: Comprehensive Vizcom tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 35K views\\\\\n\\\\\n16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvRin0zSrnA) [Design with me#8 - Car design idea exploration - getting ready before 3D modeling\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 2.1K views\\\\\n\\\\\n19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Mjf0spiwE)\n\nYou\'re signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV\'s watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Drag in an Animate block and connect it to a generation or scene you want to bring to life. From there, all it takes is a prompt.\n\nPrompting for animation works a little differently than prompting for still images. Vizcom already understands your starting image, so instead of describing details about colors and textures, focus on how things\xa0_move_. What is the object doing? How should the camera react? Are there people entering the frame or interacting with your design.\n\n_Animation prompt: Boat, sleek white hull, sparkling blue ocean, sunlit sky, gentle waves lapping, boat rocking slightly. camera moving in waves_\n\n#### What kind of stories can you tell?\n\nDesigners are already using Animate to explore motion, context, and interaction early in the process, when ideas are still forming. Here are a few workflows and prompts you can try with your concepts.\n\n##### Turntable rotation\n\nShow every angle of your design by rotating it in place, like a product reveal or studio shot.\n\n_Animation prompt: Turntable rotation of chair design, 360 degree smooth motion orbit._\n\n##### Interaction in context\n\nAdd a hand reaching into frame to pick up a tool, or a user sitting in a chair, simple ways to ground your design in real use.\n\n_Animation prompt: Power drill, cordless design, metallic finish, robust grip, light reflections shifting. single hand entering the frame from the left gripping drill and pulling trigger, lifting drill up out of frame with smooth motion._\n\n_Sketch, render, environment reference, animate. Animate prompt: Pastel chunky sneaker design, person wearing shoe, white sock, person taking step forward out of frame, slight zoom out._\n\n_Animation prompt: People walking into frame and sitting in chairs_\n\n##### Facial expressions and body language\n\nFor concept art and character exploration, Animate helps visualize subtle emotion or posture shifts that bring a persona to life.\n\n_Animation Prompts from top left to bottom right: 1-Elf touching forehead, sighing deeply, frustrated but composed emotion. 2-Elf crossing arms, slight smirk, raised eyebrow, skeptical expression. 3-Elf raising hands to cheeks in surprised emotion. 4-Elf with angry facial expression screaming at person._\n\n##### Camera reveals\n\nSlowly pan across a scene to uncover details, focus attention, or add a cinematic layer to your concept presentation\n\n_Animation Prompt: Castle, perched on rocky cliffs, ancient stone walls, towering turrets, drone shot zoom out to show adventurer back standing on mountain looking at castle, camera focus shift to person, blurs out background, illustrative style_\n\n##### Apparel Try On\n\nAnimate a model trying on apparel, turning in frame, or walking through space to bring fashion and product visuals to life.\n\n_Sketch, render, remove background, try on, animate. Animate prompt: Guy turns around, puts on the hood of the jacket and walks away from the camera._\n\n#### Access & Availability\n\nSince Animate is still in beta, each plan includes a limited number of animation credits per month. This helps us ensure quality and performance as we continue to improve the feature. We’re actively working on ways to expand access and introduce options for purchasing additional credits soon.\n\nAnimation in the Enterprise plan includes enhanced privacy and security, which may introduce slight variations in behavior compared to other plans.\n\n#### Your ideas in motion\n\nWith Animate, you can now express your ideas in motion adding interaction, behavior, and emotion to your concepts in seconds. It’s not about creating a final video. It’s about communicating the essence of your idea, early and clearly.\n\nWe’re excited to see what you bring to life and Animate in Vizcom.', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:image': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/PqbUM0oOqfHh0fGT8594PCNPEA.gif', 'generator': 'Framer 5012657', 'ogImage': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/PqbUM0oOqfHh0fGT8594PCNPEA.gif', 'ogUrl': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog/ideas-in-motion-animate-in-vizcom', 'ogTitle': 'Ideas in Motion: Animate in Vizcom', 'description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

However, we also believe that it is important to use AI in a way that empowers designers. There is a very real fear that AI could replace us, but it is of our belief that AI is simply a tool FOR designers, to help us work quickly and more creatively.\n\nOne of our core values is to ensure that designers maintain authorship over the generated designs and feel ownership over the final designs. We believe that designers should have control over the design process and that AI should be used as a tool to support their creativity, rather than as a replacement for their skills.\n\nInstagram post on Vizcom\'s account page, detailing CEO Jordan Taylor\'s mission to responsibly and ethically use AI to empower real people.\n\n## The era of AI\n\nThe era of AI is ever evolving, with the "move fast break things" mentality. Here at Vizcom, we\'re committed to responsibly and ethically harness the power of AI with the public images, and ensuring permissions when using artist data. We also prioritize security and privacy when it comes to AI-generated designs.\n\nWe understand that designers may have concerns about the security and ownership of their designs, and we take these concerns seriously. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure that designs are protected and that designers have control over who can access them.\n\n"We hear a lot about the fear that AI will replace jobs, but that\'s not quite right. AI is here to make our jobs easier - any tedious, time-consuming parts of rendering that you want to use AI for, AI will be able to assist you. The real power in designers is our creativity and our personal taste - only real people, real designers can do that."\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFinally, we believe that it is important to listen to the design community, keep a finger on the pulse of the latest developments in AI, and make improvements to our design tool that meet our community\'s ever evolving needs. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our users, and we are constantly seeking feedback to ensure that our tool is meeting the needs of designers.\n\nThank you for choosing Vizcom, and we look forward to continuing to empower designers with the power of AI.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=qiIv3YjAs&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'twitter:description': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

That’s why we built Palettes: to empower designers to teach AI about their own work, reflecting their style and values, not someone else’s. Unlike other companies, we stand for personal AI, fully owned and controlled by the creative.\n\n## Together, we can create responsibly.\n\n## **1\\. Use Your Own Work**  Create Palettes only with designs, artwork, or assets you own or have full rights to use.\n\n## **2\\. Honor Attribution**  Get clear permission before using collaborative or licensed work for training.\n\n## **3\\. Preserve Authenticity**  Focus on developing your unique style and not replicating someone else’s.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n- ## **Protect Creativity**: Innovation thrives in a culture that values originality.\n\n- ## **Respect Artists**: Give credit where it’s due, and support fair practices.\n\n- ## **Build Trust**: Foster a creative community rooted in integrity and collaboration.\n\n- ## **Empower Designers**: Lead creative work with your own voice and vision.\n\n\n## Our Promise\n\n## Palettes is designed for creativity, not appropriation.

Recently, Turkish car designer and YouTuber Berk Kaplan visited the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design (MOME) in Budapest to conduct a three-day digital sketching workshop for Vehicle Design specialization students. The workshop not only covered the fundamentals of digital sketching but also explored the growing relationship between AI and design, providing valuable insights into the future of automotive design and the importance of sketching in the era of AI.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QW2o6Xk8TdRpA5jm1gdY8YiM5dA.jpg)\n\n#### The Importance of Sketching in Design Education\n\nSketching is a fundamental skill for designers across various disciplines, allowing them to visualize and communicate their ideas quickly. As Kaplan emphasized during the workshop, sketching helps to bridge the gap between the designer's mental image and the audience's understanding. By putting ideas on paper, designers can avoid misunderstandings and ensure everyone is on the same page. This is particularly crucial in the automotive industry, where clear visual communication is essential for successful collaboration between designers, engineers, and other stakeholders.\n\n#### AI and the Future of Creative Workflows\n\nIn addition to traditional sketching techniques, the workshop also focused on the integration of AI tools like Midjourney and Vizcom into the car design process. Kaplan highlighted the surprising ways in which AI can both complement and challenge the designer's vision. While tools like Midjourney can generate unexpected results based on text prompts, Vizcom supports the designer's creative process by directly enhancing their sketches. By leveraging AI technologies, designers can save time and explore new possibilities while still maintaining their unique artistic vision.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/4AcjMlEGm20dqpYOpw0lOTb8qQ8.jpg)\n\n#### The Impact on Design Education\n\nAs AI continues to shape the future of design, it is crucial for educational institutions like MOME to adapt their curricula and provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in this new landscape. By incorporating digital sketching and AI tools into their programs, universities can prepare the next generation of designers for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. However, it is equally important to emphasize the enduring value of traditional skills like sketching, which will continue to play a vital role in the design process, even as AI technologies become more prevalent.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EYoRndPxnclctt4UiIig1PKIA.jpg)\n\nBerk Kaplan's digital sketching workshop at MOME highlights the importance of sketching in design education and the growing influence of AI on creative workflows. By embracing both traditional skills and emerging technologies, design students can position themselves for success in an increasingly complex and dynamic industry. As educational institutions continue to adapt to the changing landscape, it is clear that the future of design will be shaped by those who can effectively combine artistic vision with technological innovation.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=iS8jEKKVt&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'framer-search-index': 'https://framerusercontent.com/sites/1NDdwv2PBK7LOFnjSpkhqr/searchIndex-kT9PpIrwZP3c.json', 'description': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

Crafting a good chair balances form, proportions, ergonomics, and manufacturing techniques. This challenge led team member Chris Ference to consider how Vizcom’s rendering and 3D capabilities could enhance the design process and enable him to create a chair in just two days.\n\nThe exploration focused on creating rotomolded and injection molded chairs suitable for outdoor or dining settings. The process began with rough sketches, then transitioned into Vizcom to visualize ideas in higher fidelity. This approach allowed for the identification of strong concepts, the elimination of weaker ones, and continued ideation with greater intention and focus.\n\nThrough rounds of generating 3D forms, sketching over them, and generating new images, a deeper understanding of the desired chair design was achieved. Evaluating a number of 3D prints provided a new way to review and critique the work. The ability to hold the sketch in physical form was a unique aspect of the workflow that was found invaluable.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XugPK3jucZtT9lu4qLKkb2Z0c.jpg)\n\nThroughout the process, the aim was to create designs with a clear relationship between all elements of the chair, including the front legs, seat, backrest, and back feet. While drawing the side view of a chair, it was challenging to understand how this perspective would relate to the front and connect with the legs. The seat was envisioned as seamlessly connecting to the back and curving into the legs. By generating a 3D version of the sketch, a clearer understanding of how to resolve the form was gained.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WF39AkEXKSygUZrUMuUouXJ5yg.jpg)\n\nUsing the generated 3D object, consistent representations of the idea were achieved from various angles. Viewing the chair in its space through augmented reality also allowed for validation of proportions and seeing the chair at scale.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OpOGfy6LWIAreM6FHzExNxwzOI.jpg)\n\nIn just 48 hours, Chris was able to ideate, refine, 3D print, and go through several iterations of the chair. With traditional tools, he might have been constrained by the extensive time required for visualization and development, limiting his ability to create multiple unique ideas. Sketching as a basis for image and 3D generation makes the ideation process feel seamless for designers. Overall, this exercise not only demonstrates the power of Vizcom but also provides a compelling glimpse into how designers could work in more natural and intuitive ways.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=MxYfFoum0&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:image': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'ogTitle': 'Sketch to 3D: A Chair Design Exploration - My Framer Site', 'title': 'Sketch to 3D: A Chair Design Exploration - My Framer Site', 'ogDescription': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

With Palettes, you can curate a private AI model that learns your aesthetic, giving you the power to generate with greater consistency, explore ideas faster, and ensure every concept feels true to how you’d do it.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/IjskMESmtUodT3gN5QyQl5AbxU.gif)\n\n### Authorship\n\nEvery world-changing idea starts with a sketch. But with many generative tools, **authorship gets lost**—images are created from words alone, disconnected from the hands that inspired them. From the beginning, Vizcom has taken a different approach: your sketch guides the design process, ensuring that the results stay true to your vision.\n\nPalettes take this one step further by learning your unique style to generate images that reflect your aesthetic. By rendering your sketches with your personalized Palette, you can visualize your ideas authentically—not as generic outputs, but as creations grounded in your sketch, your aesthetic, and your creative identity.\n\n### Curate. Generate. Iterate.\n\nPalettes are built to feel like an extension of your creative process. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Curate Your Style**: Upload 4–30 images that reflect a cohesive aesthetic. These might be your past work, brand visuals, or a particular style you’re exploring.\n\n   - Keep it focused: Smaller, more specific Palettes perform better than larger, mixed ones.\n\n   - Show it all: Include multiple angles or variations to help Vizcom learn the nuances of your designs.\n2. **Train Your Palette**: Upload your images to Vizcom’s Workbench, and in just minutes, your Palette is ready to use.\n\n3. **Sketch and Generate**: Test your Palette by varying the drawing influence percentage. At 100%, Vizcom closely follows your drawing. At lower levels, it leans into the aesthetic you’ve trained. This flexibility lets you explore a spectrum of ideas without losing your stylistic identity.\n\n4. **Iterate and Share**: Use your Palette across projects, or share it with your team to ensure everyone is working in the same visual language.\n\n\nThe video below guides you through creating your first Palette.\n\n### Creations:\n\nWe’ve been amazed by what designers have already created with Palettes during testing. Here are just a few ways Palettes are helping bring ideas to life.\n\nWe’ve been working closely with Scott Robertson as he’s trained numerous Palettes to capture his sketch style. This has allowed him to rapidly iterate on a variety of landscapes and environments, all while feeling authentic to his aesthetic.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/O7DKV7LGPeFVvjpb8mSEJtPMNTE.gif)\n\nTeam member Chris Ference has created a Palette called “Bone” that allows him to render his ideas in a consistent 3d shaded style. This allows him to begin his design process creating soft organic feeling objects.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/clVUeQB4Gv2su21lxweWPYC5ls.png)\n\nPalettes are more than a feature—they represent a new way to create with Vizcom. By combining your sketches with a personalized Palette, you’re not just generating images; you’re shaping ideas that carry your style, your voice, and your vision.\n\nWe believe that great design starts with authorship. Palettes put the power back in your hands, helping you create with consistency, authenticity, and speed. Whether you're refining your own style, aligning a team around a shared aesthetic, or exploring entirely new concepts, Palettes ensure your creative process feels intuitive and uniquely yours.\n\nWe’re excited to see how you’ll use Palettes to push the boundaries of your design work. Your ideas deserve to be seen—and now, they can be, just the way you imagined.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=bXoUddrdT&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

The total Fees owed by you in connection with a subscription will be presented to you at the time of purchase and available for viewing through the App. You are responsible for selecting your desired subscription option, and you are responsible for payment of the applicable Subscription Fees at the time you elect to create a Premium Account or otherwise select your subscription. All Fees are non-refundable. You may be required to provide your credit card or other accepted payment method (each a “Payment Method”) when you subscribe to the Services or register for a Premium Account. Company reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on Apps or by e-mail delivery to you.\n\n### 5.2 AUTOMATIC RENEWAL\n\nYour subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Agreement. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period at Vizcom’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least one (1) day prior to the Renewal Commencement Date via your Account page. If you do not wish for your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log in to your Account and change or terminate your subscription via the Account page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription Fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Vizcom to charge your Payment Method now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Vizcom does not receive payment from you, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (ii) you agree that Vizcom may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Method until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and, for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).\n\n### 5.3 Cancellation Period\n\nIf you are a consumer who is a resident of the EU or the UK, you have a legal right to cancel your subscription until 14 days after the day on which the subscription was entered into. This means that during that period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want to continue receiving the Services, you can notify us of your decision to cancel your subscription and receive a refund. Advice about your legal right to cancel your subscription terms is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. To cancel a subscription, you just need to let us know that you have decided to cancel. The easiest way to do this is to cancel the subscription on your Account page. If you cancel your subscription, we will refund you the price paid for the subscription.\n\n### 5.4 Taxes\n\nThe payments required under Section 5 of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. If Vizcom determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, Vizcom shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 5 of this Agreement. If any services or payments for any services, under this Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Vizcom, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Vizcom for any liability or expense Vizcom may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Vizcom’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales, use, excise, services, or other tax measured by the value of sales.\n\n### 5.5 Payment Processor\n\nVizcom uses a third-party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) as the third-party service provider for payment services. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by our Payment Processor’s Privacy Policy, and hereby consent and authorize Vizcom and our Payment Processor to share any information and payment instructions you provide with third-party service provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.

By making a purchase, you authorize Vizcom to charge your Payment Method in accordance with this Section 5, and you agree that Vizcom is authorized to charge your Payment Method for all fees and charges due and payable to Vizcom hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT METHOD USED TO PAY ANY AMOUNTS OWED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES.\n\n### 5.6 Free Trials and Other Promotions\n\nAny free trial or other promotion that provides Premium Account features or any other additional features on the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial. At the end of the trial period, these additional features expire and any further use of the features is prohibited unless you pay the applicable subscription fee. If you are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact Company to have the charges reversed.\n\n## 6\\.

Without limiting the foregoing, Vizcom shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable.\n\n### 6.5 Enforcement\n\nWe reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review any User Content and Designs and to investigate and/or take appropriate action against you if you, in our sole discretion, violate Section 7 or any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise create liability for us or any other person.

Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to your User Content and Designs. You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to your User Content or Designs. If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Vizcom retains the right to create reasonable limits on Vizcom’s use and storage of the Content, including your User Content and Designs, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described on the Site and as otherwise determined by Vizcom in its sole discretion. Vizcom is not obligated to backup any User Content or Designs, and your User Content and Designs may be deleted at any time without prior notice. You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your User Content and Designs if you desire.\n\n### 7\\.

For contractual purposes, you (i) consent to receive communications from Vizcom in an electronic form; and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Vizcom provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were to be in a hardcopy writing.

Vizcom will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.\n\n## 10\\. THIRD-PARTY LINKS, APPLICATIONS; OTHER USERS AND THIRD PARTIES\n\n### 10.1 Third-Party Links, Applications\n\nThe Services may contain links to third-party websites and services, and applications for third parties (collectively, “Third-Party Links & Applications”). For example, we provide you with the ability to join the Vizcom Discord via a link to Discord’s website or application, accessible through the Services. Such Third-Party Links & Applications are not under the control of Vizcom, and Vizcom is not responsible for any Third-Party Links & Applications. Vizcom provides access to these Third-Party Links & Applications only as a convenience to you, and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links & Applications. You use all Third-Party Links, & Applications at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links & Applications, the applicable third-party’s terms and policies apply, including the third-party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links & Applications.\n\n### 10.2 Other Users and Third Parties\n\nEach user of the Services is solely responsible for any and all of its own User Content and Designs. Because we do not control User Content or the use of Designs, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content or use of Designs, whether provided by you or by others. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, suitability, or quality of any User Content or Designs. Your interactions with other users, including any interactions with Collaborators or third parties, are solely between you and such users and third parties.

We do not oversee the collaborations or interactions that take place in Teams nor do we oversee the use of the Designs by users. If there is a dispute between you and any user of the Services or you and any third party, we are under no obligation to become involved. Provided, however, we reserve the right to intercede in such disputes at our sole discretion.\n\n## 11\\. DISCLAIMERS\n\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND NO GUARANTEES REGARDING OUTCOMES OR PERFORMANCE. WE HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR RESULTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ADEQUACY OF ANY DESIGN OR CONTENT, OR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF A USER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USER’S USE OF THE DESIGNS. ANY CONTENT DOWNLOADED FROM OR OTHERWISE ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND ANY DEVICE YOU USE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS THAT RESULTS FROM ACCESSING SUCH CONTENT WHETHER PROVIDED BY VIZCOM OR ANOTHER USER OF THE SERVICES.

WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE.\n\nFROM TIME TO TIME, VIZCOM MAY OFFER BETA SERVICES. SUCH BETA SERVICES ARE OFFERED SOLELY FOR EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND MAY BE MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT VIZCOM’S SOLE DISCRETION. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION APPLY WITH FULL FORCE TO BETA SERVICES.\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n## 12\\. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VIZCOM (OR OUR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, EVEN IF VIZCOM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU OR PAYABLE TO YOU ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ACT, OMISSION OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; OR (II) ONE HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN VIZCOM AND YOU. FOR USERS IN THE EU, COMPANY DOES NOT IN ANY WAY SEEK TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT LIABILITY FOR (i) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY COMPANY’S NEGLIGENCE; (ii) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION; OR (iii) ANY OTHER LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY ENGLISH OR EU LAW.\n\n## 13\\. TERM AND TERMINATION\n\nSubject to this Section, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. We may suspend or terminate your rights to access and use the Services (including your Account) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Services in violation of this Agreement. Upon termination of your rights under this Agreement, your Account will be deleted and your right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your User Content associated with your Account from our live databases.

COPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nVizcom respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Services do the same. In connection with our Services, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our online Services who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights.

A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\n\nPlease note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs, and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.\n\nThe designated Copyright Agent for Vizcom is:\n\nDesignated Agent: Kaelan Richards\n\nAddress of Agent: 2989 Harrison Ave, Rochester Hills MI\n\nTelephone: 248-872-3378\n\nEmail: kaelan@vizcom.co\n\n## 15\\. INTERNATIONAL USERS AND PROVISIONS\n\nThe Services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Vizcom intends to announce such services or content in your country. The Services are controlled and offered by Vizcom from its facilities in the United States of America. Vizcom makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law. The following provisions shall apply only if you are located in the countries listed below:\n\n### 15.1 United Kingdom\n\nA third party who is not a party to the Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any provision of the Agreement, but this does not affect any right or remedy of such third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.\n\n### 15.2 Germany\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12 (Limitation of Liability), Vizcom is also not liable for acts of simple negligence (unless they cause injuries to or death of any person), except when they are caused by a breach of any substantial contractual obligations (vertragswesentliche Pflichten).\n\n## 16\\. ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\nPlease read the following arbitration agreement in this section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires that you and Vizcom arbitrate disputes against one another.\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS SECTION 16 CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND VIZCOM HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS SECTION 16 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND VIZCOM BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION 16 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 16 CAREFULLY.\n\n### 16.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement\n\nSubject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Vizcom agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services, or the Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:\n\n1. You and Vizcom may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and\n\n2. You or Vizcom may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).\n\n\nFor purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.\n\n### 16.2 Informal Dispute Resolution\n\nThere may be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Vizcom. If that occurs, Vizcom is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Vizcom agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Vizcom therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you also agree to participate in the conference.\n\nThe party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing. Notice to Vizcom that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to contact@vizcom.co or regular mail to our offices located at 1950 Cambridge Dr, Mountain View, CA 94043. The Notice must include:\n\n1. Your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one);\n\n2. The name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and\n\n3. A description of your Dispute.\n\n\nThe Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.\n\n### 16.2 Informal Dispute Resolution\n\nThere may be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Vizcom. If that occurs, Vizcom is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Vizcom agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Vizcom therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you also agree to participate in the conference.\n\nThe party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing. Notice to Vizcom that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to contact@vizcom.co or regular mail to our offices located at 1950 Cambridge Dr, Mountain View, CA 94043. The Notice must include:\n\n1. Your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one);\n\n2. The name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and\n\n3. A description of your Dispute.\n\n\nThe Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.\n\n### 16.3 Waiver of Jury Trial\n\nYOU AND VIZCOM HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Vizcom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subsection entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n\n### 16.4 Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\n\nYOU AND VIZCOM AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION 16.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection 16.9 (Batch Arbitration) entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Vizcom agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Vizcom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\n### 16.5 Rules and Forum\n\nThese Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of Notice, you and Vizcom agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS rules.\n\nA party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include:\n\n1. The name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account;\n\n2. A statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims;\n\n3. A description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars;\n\n4. A statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and\n\n5. Evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.\n\n\nIf the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that:\n\n1. The Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution;\n\n2. The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and\n\n3. The factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\n\n\nUnless you and otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in subsection 16.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n\nYou and Vizcom agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.\n\n### 16.6 Arbitrator\n\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the JAMS roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under subsection 16.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, JAMS will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.\n\n### 16.7 Authority of Arbitrator\n\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following:\n\n1. All Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n\n2. Except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n\n3. All Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n\n4. All Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\n\n\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration.” The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\n### 16.8 Attorneys\' Fees and Costs\n\nThe parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Vizcom need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n### 16.9 Batch Arbitration\n\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Vizcom agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Vizcom by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall:\n\n1. Administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests);\n\n2. Appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and\n\n3. Provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).\n\n\nAll parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Vizcom.\n\nYou and Vizcom agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include:\n\n1. The appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and\n\n2. The adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n\nThis Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.\n\n### 16.10 30-Day Right to Opt Out\n\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 1950 Cambridge Dr, Mountain View, CA 94043 within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Vizcom account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have or may enter in the future with us.\n\n### 16.11 Invalidity, Expiration\n\nExcept as provided in the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief”, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Vizcom as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitations for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time-barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n### 16.12 Modification\n\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Vizcom makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to Vizcom at: 1950 Cambridge Dr, Mountain View, CA 94043, your continued access and use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on or through the Services, following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services, or the Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. Vizcom will continue to honor any valid opt-outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.\n\n### 17.1 Generally\n\nYour relationship to Vizcom is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Vizcom’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Vizcom may freely assign this Agreement. The terms and conditions set forth in these Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.\n\n### 17.2 Export\n\nThe Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to directly or indirectly export, reexport, or transfer any U.S. technical data acquired from Vizcom, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.\n\n### 17.3 Exclusive Venue and Governing Law\n\nTo the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Vizcom agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in California. THE TERMS AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation.” If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\n### 17.6 Copyright/Trademark Information\n\nCopyright © 2024, Vizcom.

Recently, Turkish car designer and YouTuber Berk Kaplan visited the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design (MOME) in Budapest to conduct a three-day digital sketching workshop for Vehicle Design specialization students. The workshop not only covered the fundamentals of digital sketching but also explored the growing relationship between AI and design, providing valuable insights into the future of automotive design and the importance of sketching in the era of AI.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QW2o6Xk8TdRpA5jm1gdY8YiM5dA.jpg)\n\n#### The Importance of Sketching in Design Education\n\nSketching is a fundamental skill for designers across various disciplines, allowing them to visualize and communicate their ideas quickly. As Kaplan emphasized during the workshop, sketching helps to bridge the gap between the designer's mental image and the audience's understanding. By putting ideas on paper, designers can avoid misunderstandings and ensure everyone is on the same page. This is particularly crucial in the automotive industry, where clear visual communication is essential for successful collaboration between designers, engineers, and other stakeholders.\n\n#### AI and the Future of Creative Workflows\n\nIn addition to traditional sketching techniques, the workshop also focused on the integration of AI tools like Midjourney and Vizcom into the car design process. Kaplan highlighted the surprising ways in which AI can both complement and challenge the designer's vision. While tools like Midjourney can generate unexpected results based on text prompts, Vizcom supports the designer's creative process by directly enhancing their sketches. By leveraging AI technologies, designers can save time and explore new possibilities while still maintaining their unique artistic vision.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/4AcjMlEGm20dqpYOpw0lOTb8qQ8.jpg)\n\n#### The Impact on Design Education\n\nAs AI continues to shape the future of design, it is crucial for educational institutions like MOME to adapt their curricula and provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in this new landscape. By incorporating digital sketching and AI tools into their programs, universities can prepare the next generation of designers for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. However, it is equally important to emphasize the enduring value of traditional skills like sketching, which will continue to play a vital role in the design process, even as AI technologies become more prevalent.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EYoRndPxnclctt4UiIig1PKIA.jpg)\n\nBerk Kaplan's digital sketching workshop at MOME highlights the importance of sketching in design education and the growing influence of AI on creative workflows. By embracing both traditional skills and emerging technologies, design students can position themselves for success in an increasingly complex and dynamic industry. As educational institutions continue to adapt to the changing landscape, it is clear that the future of design will be shaped by those who can effectively combine artistic vision with technological innovation.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=iS8jEKKVt&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:card': 'summary_large_image', 'ogUrl': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog/the-evolving-role-of-sketching-in-design-education-insights-from-mome-s-digital-sketching-workshop', 'og:description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

This significant milestone underscores our relentless commitment to implementing top-notch security measures that keep your data safe and secure.\n\n## What SOC 2 Type 1 Means for You\n\nService Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 1 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers like Vizcom securely manage your data to protect the interests of both the organization and the privacy of its clients. It focuses on non-financial reporting controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system.\n\nIn practical terms, SOC 2 Type 1 compliance gives you, our client, the assurance that we have met the industry’s high standard for security controls. This compliance serves as third-party validation of the design and implementation of our security processes, thus instilling a higher level of trust in our platform.\n\n## Our Journey to SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance\n\nAchieving SOC 2 Type 1 compliance has been a rigorous but highly rewarding journey. It involved the meticulous efforts of our DevOps, Security, and Compliance teams to align our practices with the high standards set by SOC 2 Type 1 requirements.\n\nFrom securing our cloud-based infrastructure on AWS, employing AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit, to implementing role-based access controls, every layer of our platform has been scrutinized and fortified.\n\n## Transparency and Trust\n\nWhile achieving SOC 2 Type 1 is an accomplishment we are proud of, it's not the final destination in our journey toward ensuring a secure and compliant platform. It serves as a baseline that informs and enhances our ongoing efforts to make Vizcom a safe environment for industrial designers from renowned enterprises such as Ford, Nike, and Toyota.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our dedicated team and our loyal clients who trust us with their invaluable data. Achieving SOC 2 Type 1 compliance is just another step in our ongoing mission to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient platform that lets you focus on what you do best—designing the future.\n\nFeel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to know more about what our SOC 2 Type 1 compliance means for your organization.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=g4HwC54sg&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'ogUrl': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog-detail/2/soc-2-type-1-compliance', 'ogImage': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'og:title': 'Vizcom Achieves SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance - My Framer Site', 'framer-search-index': 'https://framerusercontent.com/sites/1NDdwv2PBK7LOFnjSpkhqr/searchIndex-kT9PpIrwZP3c.json', 'ogDescription': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

After a month immersed in discovery and development of new features and workflows, we want to remind you of our purpose: to redefine how design takes shape, one bold idea at a time.\n\n—\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WdgnZo9S6g6EbdU2rUMNp2Gj44.jpg?lossless=1)\n\nOnce, design was raw, untamed. A pen in hand, an idea sparked, and the future began its slow translation onto paper. Blueprints, napkins, notebooks—the origins of every object that defines our lives.\n\nBut the journey from sketch to substance has always been grueling.Hours bent over desks, revising and refining. Weeks to render a vision clear enough for others to see. Months—sometimes years—before that idea reached its true form in the real world.\n\nYet, the tools we relied on were never the problem. They were mirrors to our ambition, but also the limits of our reach. Now, as the pace of creation accelerates, our tools must evolve too. Design can no longer be constrained by process or hindered by time.\n\nWe believe it’s time to rethink not just the tools we use, but the very flow of creativity itself. At Vizcom, we see a world where anyone with a vision can bring it to life—instantly. Sketches breathe into renders, renders evolve into models, and the impossible becomes intuitive.\n\nThis is a future powered by AI. Not as a replacement for your voice but as an extension of it. A collaborator, tuned to your style, your instincts, and your aesthetic, moving at the speed of thought to unlock dimensions of your creativity you’ve yet to explore.\n\nImagine a world where design is not bound by repetition or delay, but one where you can iterate endlessly, choosing only what matters most. Where every artist has the power to refine their craft in seconds, turning sparks of inspiration into fully realized visions without compromise.\n\nWe believe design is the art form of our age. And every sketch is the beginning of a legacy—yours to shape. Together, let’s create tools that not only accelerate your process, but expand what you believe is possible.\n\nThe future isn’t waiting to be built. It’s sketching itself into existence, one idea at a time. **Let’s draw it together.**\n\n—\n\nWe are building Vizcom for designers like you. What is your dream tool? What features would accelerate your workflow? Drop us an email at contact \\[at\\] vizcom.co . We’d love to hear from you.

It’s the core of everything we build. This year at Milan Design Week, we put that belief into action by launching a global challenge with Decibel: reimagine the future of furniture through the lens of Vizcom and industrial design. Designers from around the world used Vizcom to develop their visions for the next generation of chairs and we took the winning concepts from 2D to full-scale reality, brought to life with robotic 3D printing and unveiled on the world’s biggest design stage.\n\nWe received more than 200 submissions from designers across the globe. Each one brought fresh perspectives and pushed the boundaries of form, function, and fabrication. The creativity was undeniable. But for our jury, the real challenge was selecting concepts that not only stood out visually but could also be brought to life at full scale using Decibel\'s advanced additive manufacturing process.\n\n#### Designer Spotlight: Brett Akop’s “Lou” Rocker\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CLn37jXKpg4MlhIQTtL2ngUx25M.jpg)\n\nOne of the standout pieces from the instillation was _Lou_, a 3D-printed rocking chair developed by designer Brett Akop. Created in Vizcom and shaped by a nonplanar printing toolpath, _Lou_ redefines what’s possible when digital ideation meets advanced fabrication.\n\nDesigned by Brett Akop, _Lou_ is a 3D-printed rocking chair that began with a single sketch in Vizcom. Brett used the tool to quickly explore silhouette, proportions, and form, allowing him to move fluidly between hand-drawn ideas and rendered visualizations. The chair’s flowing geometry was shaped with both intent and experimentation in mind, made possible by the fast iteration cycle Vizcom enables.\n\nWhat makes _Lou_ remarkable is not just its form, but how that form was created. The design takes full advantage of a nonplanar printing path, allowing the surface to curve smoothly in three dimensions without traditional layering. This approach eliminates the rigid, stepped look often associated with 3D printing, and instead produces a tactile, seamless flow that mirrors the elegance of the original sketch.\n\nBy designing directly for fabrication, Brett embraced the material behavior and constraints of robotic extrusion. The chair’s cantilevered sides, nested curvature, and single-piece construction are all intentional moves made early in Vizcom and carried through to the final print. The result is a piece that feels both sculptural and functional—a design made for the future, from the very first line.\n\n#### The KAVE Chair by [Andrew Schainker](https://www.instagram.com/andrewschainker?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D)\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YacehrIxYZNAqYe5xujQcxI.jpg)\n\n#### Bounce Lounge Chair by [Philippe Bietenholz](https://www.instagram.com/phils.products/)\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZSGWxvppR6KH6ci4owkoBI4SQyw.jpg)\n\n#### _🥇_ 1st Place: "Crystal" by Deniz Aktay\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WcrttdaWPdehyZiPkZxhZmqWWk.jpg)\n\nArchitect and designer **Deniz Aktay** delivered a standout piece with _Crystal_. The design balanced architectural precision with sculptural elegance, making it both visually striking and ready for production.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WuVQ2nsvcAa1EXnKN7ENKcqaXZM.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aPOLx9cCN7tEd26LtZAzISrIwI.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BLM1EF8tLR11GTHKt8oe5tPZEEg.jpg)\n\nPrinted at full scale, _Crystal_ became the centerpiece of the installation at **Alcova SNIA**, a long-abandoned textile factory reclaimed by nature and transformed into a living lab for the future of furniture.\n\n#### 2nd Place: "REVERIE" by Go Kul\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PsNRBhjisn0CJdQvkmk7QmaUDWQ.png)\n\n**Go Kul’s REVERIE** stood out for its fluid elegance. A single, organic sheet folded into a poetic and functional form, the design was quiet yet confident. Simple at first glance, it revealed a high level of technical refinement and captured the strength of restraint in design.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SlOhG6erSrc5KS8oAe14ZmIy7Gw.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wmWLj200lrOinLsKGj3dCMH14Y.png)\n\n#### 3rd Place: "Kokoko" by Sascha Sartory\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/pFTSwsYAiRNiKhgX7TyLF5xqo.jpg)\n\n**Sascha Sartory’s KOKOKO** explores the rhythm of geometry through softness and structure. Based in Cologne, Sartory brought a blend of modular thinking and sculptural clarity to the competition with a lounge chair that invites stillness without sacrificing personality.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/gFgnaCxb01UG95FzEgayPRuKiwY.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ngh32UcsvJMK2LyL3PB6JaZAUZk.jpg)\n\nKOKOKO is formed from a single flowing surface, where convex and concave curves fold together into a balanced silhouette. Inspired by Japanese minimalism and informed by sustainable, thoughtful design, the chair adapts easily between indoor and outdoor spaces. It’s light in appearance, grounded in comfort, and speaks to a quieter kind of innovation that encourages pause, reflection, and a return to essential form.\n\nWatch the recap: [Link](https://youtube.com/shorts/yJE8BuEB5ek)\n\n#### Meet the Jury\n\nTo narrow down over 200 global submissions, we assembled a panel of industry leaders across design, manufacturing, and emerging technology. Each submission was judged on creativity, originality, and feasibility for full-scale 3D printing.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/9QBSpkLcHchfVtk923aZcf1wQlM.png)\n\n#### Top 10 Finalists\n\nBeyond the top three, we’re excited to celebrate the full list of Top 10 Finalists. Each designer brought a distinct perspective to the challenge, offering ideas that ranged from biomorphic forms to clever modular systems. Together, they reflect the global reach of the Vizcom community and the powerful blend of imagination and precision that defines this new era of design.\n\n**1\\.

His work, particularly with Vizcom, showcases a symbiotic relationship between human creativity and machine intelligence, transforming the way we think about design, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/vkXpNNtCgDM2ceR0t4KKRG110.jpg)\n\nAs we explore Mueller's philosophy and workflow, we see a journey that begins with a solitary idea and evolves through constant exchange into a fully fleshed-out product idea, ready to be refined and introduced to the world.\n\nBelow, Dennis shares his insights and experiences, offering a first-person perspective into how he's integrated AI tools like Vizcom into his creative processes.\n\n## What's a misconception about AI's role in design?\n\n_The Creative Co-Worker_\n\nPeople are always afraid of the New. I´m always curious about it. So I started using AI design tools in 2021 and back then I thought it was kind of a nice gadget to play around with but did not see the whole potential behind it.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cHa5zOuBtu6s0zSVZ8MKmOIAwU.jpg)\n\nFor sure AI in general is under discussion and that's an important thing to do now to compare the positive and negative effects it could cause. But to find out the potential, you need to try it and judge later on. I started using Vizcom heavily at the beginning of 2023. A thing I fell in love with was the intuitive user interface. Nothing distracts you, the functions are very clear and the settings are not overwhelming.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/sFvVJQZaZzxQcB3pOMwf79SRya0.jpg)\n\nI always begin with a hand-drawn sketch and a self-written prompt, laying the groundwork for my ideas in a traditional creative manner before digital rendering. Many misunderstand this part, but to me, it's akin to an early-stage collaborator where I share initial concepts shortly after starting a project. Effective communication, even in these nascent stages, is crucial for success. Engaging in clear, unbiased exchanges with tools like AI can significantly enhance the outcome.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dGfMRfjqDVl6lYdPbWcE6E6GU.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SbOcnjWzlbhyvk1x7IcAHye2wug.jpg)\n\nI´m not saying that you should always use AI tools but in some cases, it makes sense, especially when you're stuck with new ideas and have a kind of writer's block in design. Then I always use a sketch and put it into Vizcom to create new ideas or give the initial idea a twist, edge, and/or life.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/NoIjKc8OtUFvj9Pr55sy33nZUfQ.jpg)\n\nAnother misconception is that AI tools should just render out the idea you had in your mind. I use Vizcom very organically and go with the flow. But what does this mean? I never get stuck too much on that first idea.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/eLnvu7i3dCxxdSR9axmHJwZqKaE.jpg)\n\nI trust my instincts and stay alert for the intriguing. This approach requires a creative lens to spot and appreciate unique elements. Whenever something catches my eye, even a minor detail, I make a note of it to possibly blend with other designs, shapes, or materials later. I frequently employ Procreate for initial sketches, then transfer these ideas into Vizcom to add realism and depth.\n\nTry to see Vizcom as an extension of your creative mind rather than an enemy who's stealing your job. At the end, we still guide the whole journey and make the decisions.\n\n## How do you balance\xa0Vizcom\xa0with human-centric design?\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XLNcJ33VfE5GkY9zgVmZr0qbhI.jpg)\n\nIn designing footwear, starting with the last is crucial, particularly for performance shoes, to ensure proper ergonomics and fit from the beginning. Typically, I begin with a side-view sketch as my foundation. From there, I refine my ideas by moving on to Vizcom. This stage helps me either polish my initial concept into a rendered version or explore new design directions.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DmmDU4u7ivgmfG8edxDM4Uyc6s.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/a5bVjEVmJNi1fE0jnX8pxv54s.png)\n\nA common misunderstanding about AI is thinking that once it generates hyper-realistic images, the work is complete. However, creating designs that truly cater to human needs involves multiple steps to ensure the final product is genuinely effective.\n\n## How do you see AI influencing the design process in the next 5 years?\n\nI told a lot of friends that it's an exciting time to be a designer. Sure we have some serious challenges\xa0to tackle but as soon as everybody understands the power of collaboration beautiful things can happen. Collaborations in all ways, people from different departments, companies, countries, and backgrounds, but also man and machines.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dDRydkT3A86ByRhyeGHSscLyWk.jpg)\n\nIn the next 5 years, a lot of repetitive activities will be heavily influenced\xa0by AI in design. CMFs, Tech Packs, 3d to manufacture are just a few topics creatives won't spend as much time on as they used to. This is amazing because then we will have more resources to invest in storytelling, experimenting, questioning the status quo, finding real sustainable solutions, and interacting with people more often again.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GMeBM4XciIEVHHKMfBtxUs81EVw.jpg)\n\nBesides the quantity and quality of creative ideas within a shorter timeframe\xa0will increase a lot. So, there needs to be good designers and core team members to judge all these results to take the right path.\n\n## Describe the most exciting aspect of merging industrial design with\xa0Vizcom.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XiJCVF4WVtWiMXX5C5NwWW4ucks.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JphX3wEwQL95BYgy2tAAPlnlxkc.jpg)\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning, the real strength is having a coworker now all the time. Playing ping pong with ideas creates a unique energy\xa0where sometimes it doesn't\xa0feel like work. It's more like being in a flow state, comparable with a runner's high where one idea leads to the next.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/bnVkoQlTiuNuYdF9q2HfsYqqLI.jpg)\n\nIt can get you addicted in a way. It's that magical moment when Vizcom renders out a new vision in such a hyper-realistic way, that you feel that there is something special the world did not see before.\n\n## How can young designers & students best prepare for the AI-driven design landscape?\n\nI've always been a huge fan of building fundamentals\xa0in the beginning. Especially living in a digital world, we need to learn the basics like model making to understand our physical world first. This is a very important\xa0step a lot of creatives nowadays are missing.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CNSdcLJxOafbAYIF1XwfzWNBVI.jpg)\n\nTo create innovative designs that stand the test of time, we must master ergonomics, refined silhouettes, seamless surface transitions, and the principles of the golden ratio, among other skills. It's crucial for young designers to begin incorporating these tools early in their careers. However, it's equally important for the emerging design culture to remain critical and challenge the status quo.\n\n👉 Learn more about Dennis Johann Mueller and his work [**here**](https://www.dennisjohannmueller.com/)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=fF9eKZplp&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:url': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog/using-vizcom-as-a-co-creator-a-new-era-for-footwear-design', 'framer-search-index': 'https://framerusercontent.com/sites/1NDdwv2PBK7LOFnjSpkhqr/searchIndex-kT9PpIrwZP3c.json', 'og:type': 'website', 'twitter:title': 'AI as a Design Partner: A Conversation with Dennis Johann Mueller', 'description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

With this round of funding, Vizcom aims to make its product even more intuitive, powerful, and user-friendly, while also introducing new features that will allow for more control, speed, and creativity in the ideation phase of the design process.\n\nThe seed round was led by Unusual Ventures, who were impressed with Vizcom\'s innovative approach to product design, energy & grit, and having skin in the industrial design game. With this funding, Vizcom will be able to continue its mission of helping designers ideate new and creative designs quickly, while also empowering them to render designs quickly in the fast moving era of AI.\n\nCEO Jordan Taylor (left) and CTO Kaelan Richards (right), co-founders of Vizcom.ai\n\nCEO Jordan Taylor was previously an automotive designer for Honda, where the concept of using AI to reduce rendering times of the design process was a solution to the problems he and his colleagues were facing.\n\n"This round of seed funding has given us the runway to really make our AI-powered design tool more powerful and useful than ever for designers," said CEO Jordan Taylor of Vizcom. "We believe that our tool has the potential to revolutionize the way that designers work, and we look forward to continuing to listen to our customers and make improvements that meet their evolving needs."\n\nVizcom\'s AI-powered design tool has already received positive feedback from professional designers and design students who have used it to create physical product designs, in the automotive, fashion, furniture, and manufacturing industry. With this seed round funding, Vizcom will be able to enhance its tool even further, making it easier than ever for designers to maintain authorship over the generated designs and still feel ownership over the final designs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for supporting Vizcom, and we look forward to continuing to empower designers with the power of AI.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=qEg0Ge3sI&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:image': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/MIgtDcKVAYUfTWpsBbNAJ7MMbSE.png', 'ogUrl': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog/vizcom-secures-seeed-round', 'ogDescription': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

This significant milestone underscores our relentless commitment to implementing top-notch security measures that keep your data safe and secure.\n\n## What SOC 2 Type 1 Means for You\n\nService Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 1 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers like Vizcom securely manage your data to protect the interests of both the organization and the privacy of its clients. It focuses on non-financial reporting controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system.\n\nIn practical terms, SOC 2 Type 1 compliance gives you, our client, the assurance that we have met the industry’s high standard for security controls. This compliance serves as third-party validation of the design and implementation of our security processes, thus instilling a higher level of trust in our platform.\n\n## Our Journey to SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance\n\nAchieving SOC 2 Type 1 compliance has been a rigorous but highly rewarding journey. It involved the meticulous efforts of our DevOps, Security, and Compliance teams to align our practices with the high standards set by SOC 2 Type 1 requirements.\n\nFrom securing our cloud-based infrastructure on AWS, employing AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit, to implementing role-based access controls, every layer of our platform has been scrutinized and fortified.\n\n## Transparency and Trust\n\nWhile achieving SOC 2 Type 1 is an accomplishment we are proud of, it's not the final destination in our journey toward ensuring a secure and compliant platform. It serves as a baseline that informs and enhances our ongoing efforts to make Vizcom a safe environment for industrial designers from renowned enterprises such as Ford, Nike, and Toyota.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our dedicated team and our loyal clients who trust us with their invaluable data. Achieving SOC 2 Type 1 compliance is just another step in our ongoing mission to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient platform that lets you focus on what you do best—designing the future.\n\nFeel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to know more about what our SOC 2 Type 1 compliance means for your organization.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=g4HwC54sg&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:title': 'Vizcom Achieves SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance', 'og:description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

Crafting a good chair balances form, proportions, ergonomics, and manufacturing techniques. This challenge led team member Chris Ference to consider how Vizcom’s rendering and 3D capabilities could enhance the design process and enable him to create a chair in just two days.\n\nThe exploration focused on creating rotomolded and injection molded chairs suitable for outdoor or dining settings. The process began with rough sketches, then transitioned into Vizcom to visualize ideas in higher fidelity. This approach allowed for the identification of strong concepts, the elimination of weaker ones, and continued ideation with greater intention and focus.\n\nThrough rounds of generating 3D forms, sketching over them, and generating new images, a deeper understanding of the desired chair design was achieved. Evaluating a number of 3D prints provided a new way to review and critique the work. The ability to hold the sketch in physical form was a unique aspect of the workflow that was found invaluable.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XugPK3jucZtT9lu4qLKkb2Z0c.jpg)\n\nThroughout the process, the aim was to create designs with a clear relationship between all elements of the chair, including the front legs, seat, backrest, and back feet. While drawing the side view of a chair, it was challenging to understand how this perspective would relate to the front and connect with the legs. The seat was envisioned as seamlessly connecting to the back and curving into the legs. By generating a 3D version of the sketch, a clearer understanding of how to resolve the form was gained.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WF39AkEXKSygUZrUMuUouXJ5yg.jpg)\n\nUsing the generated 3D object, consistent representations of the idea were achieved from various angles. Viewing the chair in its space through augmented reality also allowed for validation of proportions and seeing the chair at scale.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OpOGfy6LWIAreM6FHzExNxwzOI.jpg)\n\nIn just 48 hours, Chris was able to ideate, refine, 3D print, and go through several iterations of the chair. With traditional tools, he might have been constrained by the extensive time required for visualization and development, limiting his ability to create multiple unique ideas. Sketching as a basis for image and 3D generation makes the ideation process feel seamless for designers. Overall, this exercise not only demonstrates the power of Vizcom but also provides a compelling glimpse into how designers could work in more natural and intuitive ways.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=MxYfFoum0&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:title': 'Sketch to 3D: A Chair Design Exploration', 'description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

However, we also believe that it is important to use AI in a way that empowers designers. There is a very real fear that AI could replace us, but it is of our belief that AI is simply a tool FOR designers, to help us work quickly and more creatively.\n\nOne of our core values is to ensure that designers maintain authorship over the generated designs and feel ownership over the final designs. We believe that designers should have control over the design process and that AI should be used as a tool to support their creativity, rather than as a replacement for their skills.\n\nInstagram post on Vizcom\'s account page, detailing CEO Jordan Taylor\'s mission to responsibly and ethically use AI to empower real people.\n\n## The era of AI\n\nThe era of AI is ever evolving, with the "move fast break things" mentality. Here at Vizcom, we\'re committed to responsibly and ethically harness the power of AI with the public images, and ensuring permissions when using artist data. We also prioritize security and privacy when it comes to AI-generated designs.\n\nWe understand that designers may have concerns about the security and ownership of their designs, and we take these concerns seriously. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure that designs are protected and that designers have control over who can access them.\n\n"We hear a lot about the fear that AI will replace jobs, but that\'s not quite right. AI is here to make our jobs easier - any tedious, time-consuming parts of rendering that you want to use AI for, AI will be able to assist you. The real power in designers is our creativity and our personal taste - only real people, real designers can do that."\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFinally, we believe that it is important to listen to the design community, keep a finger on the pulse of the latest developments in AI, and make improvements to our design tool that meet our community\'s ever evolving needs. We are committed to providing the best possible experience for our users, and we are constantly seeking feedback to ensure that our tool is meeting the needs of designers.\n\nThank you for choosing Vizcom, and we look forward to continuing to empower designers with the power of AI.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=qiIv3YjAs&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

We tell stories about new ideas, how they’re used, who they’re for, and why they matter. We sketch, prototype, and render not just to visualize form, but to communicate intent.\n\nWith Animate, Vizcom adds motion to that storytelling toolkit. It’s a simple way to show how your concept moves, interacts, or unfolds directly from the canvas. Whether it’s a product turning, a user entering frame, or a character shifting expression, motion gives your story another layer of clarity.\n\nIntroducing Animation in Vizcom — Watch Your Ideas Move - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Vizcom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-XOa74z1aGdZRyvRBQ6UQ?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizcom.ai%2F)\n\nVizcom\n\n11.2K subscribers\n\n[Introducing Animation in Vizcom — Watch Your Ideas Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=TLGGxx7A1-nWgnYwNTA2MjAyNQ&v=SF1LafKAxlI)\n\nVizcom\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\n1/1\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\n[Learn Vizcom in 15 minutes: A Step-by-Step Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 13K views\\\\\n\\\\\n16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QIh7QK_wkI) [How to quickly render your sketches and ideate in Vizcom\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 14K views\\\\\n\\\\\n5:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDhScl5SO_0) [From Paper to Production: ONEAL\'s Design Journey with Vizcom\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 6.7K views\\\\\n\\\\\n3:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqnEwfx8Oo) [Apparel workflow - how to control colours and bring life into apparel renderings\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 4.4K views\\\\\n\\\\\n20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0X5AfGfIyA) [Getting started with Palettes\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 29K views\\\\\n\\\\\n6:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr5sYJCUOc8) [Vizcom: Comprehensive Vizcom tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 35K views\\\\\n\\\\\n16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvRin0zSrnA) [Mix: Blend the Unexpected\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 1.7K views\\\\\n\\\\\n0:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9OXHHbCAg) [Vizcom: How to fully control your renderings\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 23K views\\\\\n\\\\\n4:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvZ3AdLXeA) [Design with me #3 - Car design sketch rendering and ideation process.\\\\\n\\\\\nVizcom • 4.2K views\\\\\n\\\\\n22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlSv_3eZnWg)\n\nYou\'re signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV\'s watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Drag in an Animate block and connect it to a generation or scene you want to bring to life. From there, all it takes is a prompt.\n\nPrompting for animation works a little differently than prompting for still images. Vizcom already understands your starting image, so instead of describing details about colors and textures, focus on how things\xa0_move_. What is the object doing? How should the camera react? Are there people entering the frame or interacting with your design.\n\n_Animation prompt: Boat, sleek white hull, sparkling blue ocean, sunlit sky, gentle waves lapping, boat rocking slightly. camera moving in waves_\n\n#### What kind of stories can you tell?\n\nDesigners are already using Animate to explore motion, context, and interaction early in the process, when ideas are still forming. Here are a few workflows and prompts you can try with your concepts.\n\n##### Turntable rotation\n\nShow every angle of your design by rotating it in place, like a product reveal or studio shot.\n\n_Animation prompt: Turntable rotation of chair design, 360 degree smooth motion orbit._\n\n##### Interaction in context\n\nAdd a hand reaching into frame to pick up a tool, or a user sitting in a chair, simple ways to ground your design in real use.\n\n_Animation prompt: Power drill, cordless design, metallic finish, robust grip, light reflections shifting. single hand entering the frame from the left gripping drill and pulling trigger, lifting drill up out of frame with smooth motion._\n\n_Sketch, render, environment reference, animate. Animate prompt: Pastel chunky sneaker design, person wearing shoe, white sock, person taking step forward out of frame, slight zoom out._\n\n_Animation prompt: People walking into frame and sitting in chairs_\n\n##### Facial expressions and body language\n\nFor concept art and character exploration, Animate helps visualize subtle emotion or posture shifts that bring a persona to life.\n\n_Animation Prompts from top left to bottom right: 1-Elf touching forehead, sighing deeply, frustrated but composed emotion. 2-Elf crossing arms, slight smirk, raised eyebrow, skeptical expression. 3-Elf raising hands to cheeks in surprised emotion. 4-Elf with angry facial expression screaming at person._\n\n##### Camera reveals\n\nSlowly pan across a scene to uncover details, focus attention, or add a cinematic layer to your concept presentation\n\n_Animation Prompt: Castle, perched on rocky cliffs, ancient stone walls, towering turrets, drone shot zoom out to show adventurer back standing on mountain looking at castle, camera focus shift to person, blurs out background, illustrative style_\n\n##### Apparel Try On\n\nAnimate a model trying on apparel, turning in frame, or walking through space to bring fashion and product visuals to life.\n\n_Sketch, render, remove background, try on, animate. Animate prompt: Guy turns around, puts on the hood of the jacket and walks away from the camera._\n\n#### Access & Availability\n\nSince Animate is still in beta, each plan includes a limited number of animation credits per month. This helps us ensure quality and performance as we continue to improve the feature. We’re actively working on ways to expand access and introduce options for purchasing additional credits soon.\n\nAnimation in the Enterprise plan includes enhanced privacy and security, which may introduce slight variations in behavior compared to other plans.\n\n#### Your ideas in motion\n\nWith Animate, you can now express your ideas in motion adding interaction, behavior, and emotion to your concepts in seconds. It’s not about creating a final video. It’s about communicating the essence of your idea, early and clearly.\n\nWe’re excited to see what you bring to life and Animate in Vizcom.', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:description': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

We had recently met with Cycle, a small company led by Volkswagen industrial designers Matthieu Lanternat and Simon DeFoort, dedicated to connecting students with the latest design tools and empowering them to be creative in the modern age. Once we met with the pair, we knew this would be an incredible opportunity to connect with the latest cohort of design students and get a sense of their latest design workflows and where Vizcom can supercharge their creative process.\n\nVizcom sponsored the February 2023 cohort of their workshop called Creative Camp, which created a heads-down pressure intensive environment where design students could get real world professional experience designing on a deadline, with a mix of old and new tools. We spent some time introducing where AI-powered design tools like Vizcom could fit into their design process.\n\nStudents at Rubika, a design school located in Valenciennes, France. Students are shown here testing out Vizcom, sketching their product designs.\n\nAs students ideated and rendered their concepts quickly on Vizcom, we asked for feedback on their experience with the AI overall as well as their opinion on Vizcom’s take on AI. We were thrilled to find that many of our design students loved using Vizcom. They were impressed with how intuitive and easy to use it was, and they found that it helped them to create better designs more quickly, and have “happy accidents” when the AI showed them something they previously would not have thought about.\n\n"(Vizcom) is way better compared to other AI tools because it’s really in touch with the world of design and not too artistic like other AI image generators" - Student at Rubika\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLooking back, we can see that the partnership with Cycle was an incredible opportunity to meet young designers and understand their specific design process and opinions around AI. The transparency around the fears and doubts around AI were needed to understand how we can better make technology for real people, and not replace but empower real designers. Vizcom is focused on creating an ethical, empowering tool that professional designers will love. We thank Matthieu, Simon, and the students at Rubika again for a memorable workshop.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=gj8tRwqsO&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'ogImage': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'og:title': 'Partnership: Cycle + Vizcom - My Framer Site', 'generator': 'Framer 5012657', 'og:type': 'website', 'favicon': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/ziXYiScVkndF8puj7q12BZ6j3E.png', 'title': 'Partnership: Cycle + Vizcom - My Framer Site', 'framer-search-index': 'https://framerusercontent.com/sites/1NDdwv2PBK7LOFnjSpkhqr/searchIndex-kT9PpIrwZP3c.json', 'ogDescription': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

Today, we are excited to continue this mission by enabling you to generate 3D geometry from a photo or drawing. This step forward makes 3D design more intuitive, enabling you to see your idea in a new dimension.\n\n3D models play an essential role of the design process, communicating scale, form, and materials that sketches often lack. They provide us with an understanding of how an object will feel rather than just how it looks. We're able to assess these models to make decisions, and determine how to move forward with a project.\n\nGiven the complexity of traditional CAD programs, creating 3D is not often part of the ideation process. Translating ideas from paper to 3D can be difficult, and takes a great deal of time to accurately capture the proportions and gesture of a sketch. This lengthy process discourages broad exploration, pushing designers towards early decision-making rather than expansive idea exploration.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/w9TpW9Hv61qvwL9w0Pol9E.png)\n\nIn Vizcom, your drawing acts as the foundation for generating a 3d model. Once your sketch is rendered, a 3D model can be created in a matter of seconds. By rapidly bridging dimensions, this feature offers immediate feedback on how an idea looks and feels from all angles.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/HS0odR8zVvUkSR3IRdFzAp1ns.jpg)\n\n3D can be generated from more than just a sketch. Capturing a well-lit prototype allows Vizcom to reconstruct the geometry and digitize your work.\n\nGenerating a 3D model is not the end of the iteration process inside of Vizcom. Models can be viewed as layers inside Vizcom, allowing you to use it as an underlay to continue sketching and generating new ideas.\n\nWe believe these new tools will change the way we design and develop ideas. With the ability to generate 3D from drawings, we hope designers will find themselves liberated to experiment more freely, push the boundaries of creativity, and achieve a deeper understanding of their concepts earlier in the process. This is only our first step into the world of generative 3D. We continue developing new technologies and tools that empower designers to imagine their ideas no matter the dimension.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, we will be rolling out this feature inside an updated drawing interface. We can't wait to see what you make with it.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=SO9gu3BiI&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:title': 'Bridging the Gap Between 2D and 3D', 'twitter:description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

Vizcom has not worked directly with Dyson. All Dyson product images used for training were sourced ethically from publicly available sources, not from private company data. The customized model described is hypothetical and intended solely to showcase Vizcom's capabilities, not to imply an actual relationship with or endorsement from Dyson.**_\n\nAt Vizcom, we believe in the simple power of great design. That's why we're dedicated to creating tools that amplify human creativity through technology. Our latest product offering includes custom Vizcom models trained exclusively for you, on our own design data.\n\nLeading design studios worldwide, teams face immense pressure to rapidly ideate and iterate on product concepts. But manual rendering and prototyping can be painstakingly slow. These bespoke models can capture the essence of each organization's unique aesthetic. Imagine years of your brand's legacy distilled into a version of Vizcom imbued with your creative ethos. This tailored version of Vizcom becomes an engine to carry your ideas to new destinations.\n\n## Why train your own Vizcom model?\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JupgiafiWqAnfGIMm9VluqsS4.png)\n\nHistorical design and creative assets accumulated over the years might include product sketches, packaging designs, brand imagery, and more. These are often underutilized and are completely forgotten about once they are no longer relevant or needed for a project.\n\nThat's why we provide customized AI solutions that uncover the hidden potential within your existing creative data. Through our data curation service, we build tailored models that learn the nuances and styles unique to each context.\n\nBy ingesting and analyzing years of design history and brand aesthetics, Vizcom develops an innate understanding of what makes each studio work exceptional. The models capture everything from the subtle stylistic flourishes to the engineering practicalities that define a brand's identity.\n\n#### Secure and Exclusive\n\nThis is a personalized model that is exclusive to your organization, meaning it's designed to understand and embody your unique brand identity and history while remaining entirely within your control. The model and the insights it generates are solely yours, and will not be used to train other models or shared with other clients.\n\n## The Power of Tailored Vizcom Models\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/2fdY3WFlmLcVpFq5sljfrGSi4A.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UpVkXcN7BVt89MSOzsu88tFa0Q.png)\n\nTo demonstrate the power of the tailored Vizcom model, we trained Vizcom exclusively on publicly available images of Dyson appliance designs. This ethical sourcing was purely for educational purposes. By feeding the Vizcom Dyson product images, the model learned their signature look. It could then generate novel appliance concepts aligned to the Dyson visual language.\n\nWe carefully tailor the training process for each scenario: curating data, iterating on model architecture, and incorporating feedback. Protecting your IP is our highest priority.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WzESfiiVl47NhWqv6jfpXv2n0ZY.png)\n\nThis example highlights how Vizcom can build custom models focused on a target brand aesthetic using appropriate public data. The AI learns the nuances of a design language without direct access to private company assets.\n\n## Unlocking Creative Potential\n\nImagine having an AI specialist on your team who grew up studying your brand's aesthetics and catalog.

It’s the core of everything we build. This year at Milan Design Week, we put that belief into action by launching a global challenge with Decibel: reimagine the future of furniture through the lens of Vizcom and industrial design. Designers from around the world used Vizcom to develop their visions for the next generation of chairs and we took the winning concepts from 2D to full-scale reality, brought to life with robotic 3D printing and unveiled on the world’s biggest design stage.\n\nWe received more than 200 submissions from designers across the globe. Each one brought fresh perspectives and pushed the boundaries of form, function, and fabrication. The creativity was undeniable. But for our jury, the real challenge was selecting concepts that not only stood out visually but could also be brought to life at full scale using Decibel\'s advanced additive manufacturing process.\n\n#### Designer Spotlight: Brett Akop’s “Lou” Rocker\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CLn37jXKpg4MlhIQTtL2ngUx25M.jpg)\n\nOne of the standout pieces from the instillation was _Lou_, a 3D-printed rocking chair developed by designer Brett Akop. Created in Vizcom and shaped by a nonplanar printing toolpath, _Lou_ redefines what’s possible when digital ideation meets advanced fabrication.\n\nDesigned by Brett Akop, _Lou_ is a 3D-printed rocking chair that began with a single sketch in Vizcom. Brett used the tool to quickly explore silhouette, proportions, and form, allowing him to move fluidly between hand-drawn ideas and rendered visualizations. The chair’s flowing geometry was shaped with both intent and experimentation in mind, made possible by the fast iteration cycle Vizcom enables.\n\nWhat makes _Lou_ remarkable is not just its form, but how that form was created. The design takes full advantage of a nonplanar printing path, allowing the surface to curve smoothly in three dimensions without traditional layering. This approach eliminates the rigid, stepped look often associated with 3D printing, and instead produces a tactile, seamless flow that mirrors the elegance of the original sketch.\n\nBy designing directly for fabrication, Brett embraced the material behavior and constraints of robotic extrusion. The chair’s cantilevered sides, nested curvature, and single-piece construction are all intentional moves made early in Vizcom and carried through to the final print. The result is a piece that feels both sculptural and functional—a design made for the future, from the very first line.\n\n#### The KAVE Chair by [Andrew Schainker](https://www.instagram.com/andrewschainker?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D)\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YacehrIxYZNAqYe5xujQcxI.jpg)\n\n#### Bounce Lounge Chair by [Philippe Bietenholz](https://www.instagram.com/phils.products/)\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZSGWxvppR6KH6ci4owkoBI4SQyw.jpg)\n\n#### _🥇_ 1st Place: "Crystal" by Deniz Aktay\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WcrttdaWPdehyZiPkZxhZmqWWk.jpg)\n\nArchitect and designer **Deniz Aktay** delivered a standout piece with _Crystal_. The design balanced architectural precision with sculptural elegance, making it both visually striking and ready for production.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WuVQ2nsvcAa1EXnKN7ENKcqaXZM.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aPOLx9cCN7tEd26LtZAzISrIwI.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BLM1EF8tLR11GTHKt8oe5tPZEEg.jpg)\n\nPrinted at full scale, _Crystal_ became the centerpiece of the installation at **Alcova SNIA**, a long-abandoned textile factory reclaimed by nature and transformed into a living lab for the future of furniture.\n\n#### 2nd Place: "REVERIE" by Go Kul\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PsNRBhjisn0CJdQvkmk7QmaUDWQ.png)\n\n**Go Kul’s REVERIE** stood out for its fluid elegance. A single, organic sheet folded into a poetic and functional form, the design was quiet yet confident. Simple at first glance, it revealed a high level of technical refinement and captured the strength of restraint in design.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SlOhG6erSrc5KS8oAe14ZmIy7Gw.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wmWLj200lrOinLsKGj3dCMH14Y.png)\n\n#### 3rd Place: "Kokoko" by Sascha Sartory\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/pFTSwsYAiRNiKhgX7TyLF5xqo.jpg)\n\n**Sascha Sartory’s KOKOKO** explores the rhythm of geometry through softness and structure. Based in Cologne, Sartory brought a blend of modular thinking and sculptural clarity to the competition with a lounge chair that invites stillness without sacrificing personality.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/gFgnaCxb01UG95FzEgayPRuKiwY.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ngh32UcsvJMK2LyL3PB6JaZAUZk.jpg)\n\nKOKOKO is formed from a single flowing surface, where convex and concave curves fold together into a balanced silhouette. Inspired by Japanese minimalism and informed by sustainable, thoughtful design, the chair adapts easily between indoor and outdoor spaces. It’s light in appearance, grounded in comfort, and speaks to a quieter kind of innovation that encourages pause, reflection, and a return to essential form.\n\nWatch the recap: [Link](https://youtube.com/shorts/yJE8BuEB5ek)\n\n#### Meet the Jury\n\nTo narrow down over 200 global submissions, we assembled a panel of industry leaders across design, manufacturing, and emerging technology. Each submission was judged on creativity, originality, and feasibility for full-scale 3D printing.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/9QBSpkLcHchfVtk923aZcf1wQlM.png)\n\n#### Top 10 Finalists\n\nBeyond the top three, we’re excited to celebrate the full list of Top 10 Finalists. Each designer brought a distinct perspective to the challenge, offering ideas that ranged from biomorphic forms to clever modular systems. Together, they reflect the global reach of the Vizcom community and the powerful blend of imagination and precision that defines this new era of design.\n\n**1\\.

We had recently met with Cycle, a small company led by Volkswagen industrial designers Matthieu Lanternat and Simon DeFoort, dedicated to connecting students with the latest design tools and empowering them to be creative in the modern age. Once we met with the pair, we knew this would be an incredible opportunity to connect with the latest cohort of design students and get a sense of their latest design workflows and where Vizcom can supercharge their creative process.\n\nVizcom sponsored the February 2023 cohort of their workshop called Creative Camp, which created a heads-down pressure intensive environment where design students could get real world professional experience designing on a deadline, with a mix of old and new tools. We spent some time introducing where AI-powered design tools like Vizcom could fit into their design process.\n\nStudents at Rubika, a design school located in Valenciennes, France. Students are shown here testing out Vizcom, sketching their product designs.\n\nAs students ideated and rendered their concepts quickly on Vizcom, we asked for feedback on their experience with the AI overall as well as their opinion on Vizcom’s take on AI. We were thrilled to find that many of our design students loved using Vizcom. They were impressed with how intuitive and easy to use it was, and they found that it helped them to create better designs more quickly, and have “happy accidents” when the AI showed them something they previously would not have thought about.\n\n"(Vizcom) is way better compared to other AI tools because it’s really in touch with the world of design and not too artistic like other AI image generators" - Student at Rubika\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLooking back, we can see that the partnership with Cycle was an incredible opportunity to meet young designers and understand their specific design process and opinions around AI. The transparency around the fears and doubts around AI were needed to understand how we can better make technology for real people, and not replace but empower real designers. Vizcom is focused on creating an ethical, empowering tool that professional designers will love. We thank Matthieu, Simon, and the students at Rubika again for a memorable workshop.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=gj8tRwqsO&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'twitter:title': 'Partnership: Cycle + Vizcom', 'og:title': 'Partnership: Cycle + Vizcom', 'description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

Vizcom has not worked directly with Dyson. All Dyson product images used for training were sourced ethically from publicly available sources, not from private company data. The customized model described is hypothetical and intended solely to showcase Vizcom's capabilities, not to imply an actual relationship with or endorsement from Dyson.**_\n\nAt Vizcom, we believe in the simple power of great design. That's why we're dedicated to creating tools that amplify human creativity through technology. Our latest product offering includes custom Vizcom models trained exclusively for you, on our own design data.\n\nLeading design studios worldwide, teams face immense pressure to rapidly ideate and iterate on product concepts. But manual rendering and prototyping can be painstakingly slow. These bespoke models can capture the essence of each organization's unique aesthetic. Imagine years of your brand's legacy distilled into a version of Vizcom imbued with your creative ethos. This tailored version of Vizcom becomes an engine to carry your ideas to new destinations.\n\n## Why train your own Vizcom model?\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JupgiafiWqAnfGIMm9VluqsS4.png)\n\nHistorical design and creative assets accumulated over the years might include product sketches, packaging designs, brand imagery, and more. These are often underutilized and are completely forgotten about once they are no longer relevant or needed for a project.\n\nThat's why we provide customized AI solutions that uncover the hidden potential within your existing creative data. Through our data curation service, we build tailored models that learn the nuances and styles unique to each context.\n\nBy ingesting and analyzing years of design history and brand aesthetics, Vizcom develops an innate understanding of what makes each studio work exceptional. The models capture everything from the subtle stylistic flourishes to the engineering practicalities that define a brand's identity.\n\n#### Secure and Exclusive\n\nThis is a personalized model that is exclusive to your organization, meaning it's designed to understand and embody your unique brand identity and history while remaining entirely within your control. The model and the insights it generates are solely yours, and will not be used to train other models or shared with other clients.\n\n## The Power of Tailored Vizcom Models\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/2fdY3WFlmLcVpFq5sljfrGSi4A.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UpVkXcN7BVt89MSOzsu88tFa0Q.png)\n\nTo demonstrate the power of the tailored Vizcom model, we trained Vizcom exclusively on publicly available images of Dyson appliance designs. This ethical sourcing was purely for educational purposes. By feeding the Vizcom Dyson product images, the model learned their signature look. It could then generate novel appliance concepts aligned to the Dyson visual language.\n\nWe carefully tailor the training process for each scenario: curating data, iterating on model architecture, and incorporating feedback. Protecting your IP is our highest priority.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WzESfiiVl47NhWqv6jfpXv2n0ZY.png)\n\nThis example highlights how Vizcom can build custom models focused on a target brand aesthetic using appropriate public data. The AI learns the nuances of a design language without direct access to private company assets.\n\n## Unlocking Creative Potential\n\nImagine having an AI specialist on your team who grew up studying your brand's aesthetics and catalog. With a custom model from Vizcom, it's like having a personal apprentice at your side.\n\nFeed it a quick sketch, and watch as your AI partner analyzes the angle, lighting, colors, materials, finishes, and proportions that define your style. In an instant, it renders the sketch into a striking product shot, as if your most talented visual protégé brought your idea to life.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YFVmP9n4ZupdDf2RBPgGBIIWkys.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/riP7tKhKeFriEVkOTIi6UMwtco.png)\n\nThe results unlock something special in the creative process. With your custom AI, you maintain authorship while possibilities take shape before your eyes.\xa0Our custom model can transform any rough sketch into a production-quality render in seconds while maintaining your distinctive style.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/g3yDyfcUXWftLOuEINNKOIzdIsY.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/s0yQmp1Mb7ytsVU6BSYMvpZM.png)\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hXIC1SgZCPSfPNzYIKOVNNiLR6U.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Cmqrb5fR677RKBIKQ8HJgJUhLo.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/FQWSjhexZzspucnuyV1mDjmtbq8.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TX3SIQxabQBuRUWHyulNdtLNdO8.png)\n\nThis allows you to accelerate your ideation process by collaborating with a version of Vizcom that intrinsically understands your design language.

We wanted to give designers a creative accelerant that would bring their ideas to life faster and more efficiently, while still keeping them firmly in the driver's seat.\n\nWe've raised $20 million in Series A funding, led by the visionary team at [Index Ventures](https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/inside-vizcoms-vision-to-transform-industrial-design-with-ai/) and joined by an exceptional group of angel investors: [Kyle Parrish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kparrish8?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAHl9mgBorq_ciYOx95bhByKzqN2Wc6zdA4&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BqvDNuJN9Td6fAh%2FRL9RcKA%3D%3D), [Steve Malouf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevemalouf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAEGkKABCJKRWR-mUXhYFjOB6mrYr-Ek4LM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3B%2BVtEkcCXTDyX%2BCkmXfSl%2FA%3D%3D), [Ayush Sood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayushsood?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAARUNakBcEBX8HDkfCNbcUFElBZH5Ey6328&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BAt1xE3JqT3WKJ8s1rHGapw%3D%3D), and [Daniel Sturman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsturman?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAADYHLQBymJGc_-nSS0idWUezaXyI6-phpA&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BdpthXH1iSdKzMaH%2B%2FYddVQ%3D%3D). This funding will allow us to supercharge our efforts to revolutionize how products and objects come to life with AI.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TvtHPrsCINat4llwRrX1fEEFp4.png)\n\nWe'll be significantly expanding our product development efforts, adding even more capabilities to enhance every stage of the design process. From turning simple sketches into photorealistic renders to creating bespoke custom models to integrating with 3D modeling and printing - we're building an end-to-end platform that will take designers from initial concept to physical prototype faster than ever before.\n\nWe'll also be growing our team, bringing in more of the brightest minds in design and technology to help us achieve our mission. And we'll be scaling up our enterprise offerings, partnering with more innovative companies to transform the way they approach design.\n\nWe could not be more grateful for the support of our customers, our investors, and most of all, our incredible team. Your belief in our vision is what has brought us this far.\n\n**If you’re interested in joining our mission to push creativity forward, see our open roles at** [**vizcom.ai/careers**](https://www.vizcom.ai/careers)\n\nJordan Taylor\n\nCEO & Co-Founder, Vizcom\n\nYou can also check out what our lead investor, Index Ventures, has to say about their investment in Vizcom: [https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/inside-vizcoms-vision-to-transform-industrial-design-with-ai/](https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/inside-vizcoms-vision-to-transform-industrial-design-with-ai/)\n\nAnd for an in-depth look at our journey check out\xa0this Forbes article: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/03/27/ai-design-software-startup-raises-20-million-to-expand-beyond-cars-and-shoes-vizcom-jordan-taylor-ford-new-balance/?sh=6d975096a581](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/03/27/ai-design-software-startup-raises-20-million-to-expand-beyond-cars-and-shoes-vizcom-jordan-taylor-ford-new-balance/?sh=6d975096a581)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=kjAhzZbdU&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:type': 'website', 'description': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

The 30-Second Version\n\n| Topic | Free Plan | Paid Plans (Pro, Enterprise, Education) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Who owns your uploads & designs?** | You do. | You do. |\n| **Can Vizcom use your data to improve its AI?** | Yes – anonymized & aggregated only. | **No**, unless **you** opt-in. |\n| **Can Vizcom show your work publicly?** | No. Internal use only. | No. |\n| **What happens if you delete content?** | Vizcom’s license ends. | Vizcom’s license ends. |\n| License you grant Vizcom | Broad, royalty-free, to run the service **and refine our models.** | Narrow, purely to deliver the service you asked for. |\n\n### 2\\. Ownership Stays With You\n\n- **User Content**\n\nEverything you upload (images, CAD files, prompts, etc.) is yours. You keep the copyright.\n\n- **Designs**\n\nAll outputs the platform generates for you are also yours. Vizcom never claims exclusive or joint ownership.\n\n\n### 3\\. How Your Data Is (and Isn’t) Used\n\n#### Free Plan\n\nTo keep the free tier sustainable, you grant Vizcom a _non-exclusive, worldwide_ license to:\n\n- Run the core service.\n\n- **Improve our AI models and features** using _anonymized_ data.\n\n- Store back-ups so your projects don’t disappear.\n\n\nThere is **no public redistribution** of your work, ever.\n\nDelete the file → the license ends.\n\n#### Paid Plans (Pro, Enterprise, Education)\n\nYou grant Vizcom a _limited_ license to:\n\n- Render, store and serve your files.\n\n- Perform routine back-ups.\n\n\n**What we do NOT do:**\n\n- Train on your data.\n\n- Analyze, label or mine it for product development.\n\n- Share it with third parties.\n\n\nIf you _want_ to let us use a project for joint marketing or research, we’ll ask and get it in writing first.\n\n### 4\\. Security at Every Step\n\n- **Encryption in transit & at rest** — industry-standard TLS and AES-256.\n\n- **Strict access controls** — only you (and teammates you invite) see your files.\n\n- **No third-party data sales** — ever.\n\n\n### 5\\. Switching Plans? Your Old Rights Stick\n\n- Designs created while you were a **Paid** user keep the Paid license, even if you later drop to Free.\n\n- New uploads after downgrading follow the Free-plan rules.\n\n\n### 6\\. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n| Question | Quick Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Does Vizcom train on Enterprise data?** | No, unless you give explicit written permission. |\n| **Can Vizcom claim my artwork?** | Never. You’re the sole owner; we get only the narrow service license. |\n| **What if my design looks similar to someone else’s?** | Vizcom provides a tool; you remain responsible for ensuring your use doesn’t infringe third-party IP. |\n| **Why do Free users grant a broader license?** | It funds continual model improvement so we can keep a no-cost tier alive. |\n| **Are beta features safe?** | Yes. Paid-user data in beta features still follows the Paid-plan rules. |\n\n- **Full Terms & Conditions** — https://www.vizcom.ai/terms-of-service\n\n- **Privacy & Security White-Paper** — available on request.\n\n- **Enterprise Questions?** — email **hello@vizcom.ai**.\n\n\n© 2025 Vizcom Technologies, Inc.

It provides structure without limiting creativity by:\n\n- Specifying details that are hard to express in a sketch (e.g., materials, lighting)\n\n- Highlighting areas open to exploration\n\n- Including relevant technical rendering parameters\n\n\nStrong prompts guide the AI by clarifying your intent while still allowing room for creative interpretation and variation.\n\nWhen a prompt is vague, inconsistent, or overly broad, the AI may misinterpret your design intent. This can lead to outcomes that:\n\n- Overlook important visual or material details\n\n- Default to bland or generic results\n\n- Drift significantly from your intended direction\n\n\nThis often occurs when the sketch is ambiguous and the prompt lacks sufficient guidance to steer the AI effectively.\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/b19ZwALShA90IJxliTbq1zI4OMA.png)\n\n##### Vague prompting\n\nWhen a prompt is vague, inconsistent, or overly broad, the AI may misinterpret your design intent.

His work, particularly with Vizcom, showcases a symbiotic relationship between human creativity and machine intelligence, transforming the way we think about design, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/vkXpNNtCgDM2ceR0t4KKRG110.jpg)\n\nAs we explore Mueller's philosophy and workflow, we see a journey that begins with a solitary idea and evolves through constant exchange into a fully fleshed-out product idea, ready to be refined and introduced to the world.\n\nBelow, Dennis shares his insights and experiences, offering a first-person perspective into how he's integrated AI tools like Vizcom into his creative processes.\n\n## What's a misconception about AI's role in design?\n\n_The Creative Co-Worker_\n\nPeople are always afraid of the New. I´m always curious about it. So I started using AI design tools in 2021 and back then I thought it was kind of a nice gadget to play around with but did not see the whole potential behind it.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cHa5zOuBtu6s0zSVZ8MKmOIAwU.jpg)\n\nFor sure AI in general is under discussion and that's an important thing to do now to compare the positive and negative effects it could cause. But to find out the potential, you need to try it and judge later on. I started using Vizcom heavily at the beginning of 2023. A thing I fell in love with was the intuitive user interface. Nothing distracts you, the functions are very clear and the settings are not overwhelming.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/sFvVJQZaZzxQcB3pOMwf79SRya0.jpg)\n\nI always begin with a hand-drawn sketch and a self-written prompt, laying the groundwork for my ideas in a traditional creative manner before digital rendering. Many misunderstand this part, but to me, it's akin to an early-stage collaborator where I share initial concepts shortly after starting a project. Effective communication, even in these nascent stages, is crucial for success. Engaging in clear, unbiased exchanges with tools like AI can significantly enhance the outcome.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dGfMRfjqDVl6lYdPbWcE6E6GU.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SbOcnjWzlbhyvk1x7IcAHye2wug.jpg)\n\nI´m not saying that you should always use AI tools but in some cases, it makes sense, especially when you're stuck with new ideas and have a kind of writer's block in design. Then I always use a sketch and put it into Vizcom to create new ideas or give the initial idea a twist, edge, and/or life.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/NoIjKc8OtUFvj9Pr55sy33nZUfQ.jpg)\n\nAnother misconception is that AI tools should just render out the idea you had in your mind. I use Vizcom very organically and go with the flow. But what does this mean? I never get stuck too much on that first idea.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/eLnvu7i3dCxxdSR9axmHJwZqKaE.jpg)\n\nI trust my instincts and stay alert for the intriguing. This approach requires a creative lens to spot and appreciate unique elements. Whenever something catches my eye, even a minor detail, I make a note of it to possibly blend with other designs, shapes, or materials later. I frequently employ Procreate for initial sketches, then transfer these ideas into Vizcom to add realism and depth.\n\nTry to see Vizcom as an extension of your creative mind rather than an enemy who's stealing your job. At the end, we still guide the whole journey and make the decisions.\n\n## How do you balance\xa0Vizcom\xa0with human-centric design?\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XLNcJ33VfE5GkY9zgVmZr0qbhI.jpg)\n\nIn designing footwear, starting with the last is crucial, particularly for performance shoes, to ensure proper ergonomics and fit from the beginning. Typically, I begin with a side-view sketch as my foundation. From there, I refine my ideas by moving on to Vizcom. This stage helps me either polish my initial concept into a rendered version or explore new design directions.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DmmDU4u7ivgmfG8edxDM4Uyc6s.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/a5bVjEVmJNi1fE0jnX8pxv54s.png)\n\nA common misunderstanding about AI is thinking that once it generates hyper-realistic images, the work is complete. However, creating designs that truly cater to human needs involves multiple steps to ensure the final product is genuinely effective.\n\n## How do you see AI influencing the design process in the next 5 years?\n\nI told a lot of friends that it's an exciting time to be a designer. Sure we have some serious challenges\xa0to tackle but as soon as everybody understands the power of collaboration beautiful things can happen. Collaborations in all ways, people from different departments, companies, countries, and backgrounds, but also man and machines.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dDRydkT3A86ByRhyeGHSscLyWk.jpg)\n\nIn the next 5 years, a lot of repetitive activities will be heavily influenced\xa0by AI in design. CMFs, Tech Packs, 3d to manufacture are just a few topics creatives won't spend as much time on as they used to. This is amazing because then we will have more resources to invest in storytelling, experimenting, questioning the status quo, finding real sustainable solutions, and interacting with people more often again.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GMeBM4XciIEVHHKMfBtxUs81EVw.jpg)\n\nBesides the quantity and quality of creative ideas within a shorter timeframe\xa0will increase a lot. So, there needs to be good designers and core team members to judge all these results to take the right path.\n\n## Describe the most exciting aspect of merging industrial design with\xa0Vizcom.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XiJCVF4WVtWiMXX5C5NwWW4ucks.jpg)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JphX3wEwQL95BYgy2tAAPlnlxkc.jpg)\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning, the real strength is having a coworker now all the time. Playing ping pong with ideas creates a unique energy\xa0where sometimes it doesn't\xa0feel like work. It's more like being in a flow state, comparable with a runner's high where one idea leads to the next.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/bnVkoQlTiuNuYdF9q2HfsYqqLI.jpg)\n\nIt can get you addicted in a way. It's that magical moment when Vizcom renders out a new vision in such a hyper-realistic way, that you feel that there is something special the world did not see before.\n\n## How can young designers & students best prepare for the AI-driven design landscape?\n\nI've always been a huge fan of building fundamentals\xa0in the beginning. Especially living in a digital world, we need to learn the basics like model making to understand our physical world first. This is a very important\xa0step a lot of creatives nowadays are missing.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CNSdcLJxOafbAYIF1XwfzWNBVI.jpg)\n\nTo create innovative designs that stand the test of time, we must master ergonomics, refined silhouettes, seamless surface transitions, and the principles of the golden ratio, among other skills. It's crucial for young designers to begin incorporating these tools early in their careers. However, it's equally important for the emerging design culture to remain critical and challenge the status quo.\n\n👉 Learn more about Dennis Johann Mueller and his work [**here**](https://www.dennisjohannmueller.com/)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=fF9eKZplp&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'og:image': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'viewport': 'width=1200', 'og:type': 'website', 'generator': 'Framer 5012657', 'description': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

After a month immersed in discovery and development of new features and workflows, we want to remind you of our purpose: to redefine how design takes shape, one bold idea at a time.\n\n—\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WdgnZo9S6g6EbdU2rUMNp2Gj44.jpg?lossless=1)\n\nOnce, design was raw, untamed. A pen in hand, an idea sparked, and the future began its slow translation onto paper. Blueprints, napkins, notebooks—the origins of every object that defines our lives.\n\nBut the journey from sketch to substance has always been grueling.Hours bent over desks, revising and refining. Weeks to render a vision clear enough for others to see. Months—sometimes years—before that idea reached its true form in the real world.\n\nYet, the tools we relied on were never the problem. They were mirrors to our ambition, but also the limits of our reach. Now, as the pace of creation accelerates, our tools must evolve too. Design can no longer be constrained by process or hindered by time.\n\nWe believe it’s time to rethink not just the tools we use, but the very flow of creativity itself. At Vizcom, we see a world where anyone with a vision can bring it to life—instantly. Sketches breathe into renders, renders evolve into models, and the impossible becomes intuitive.\n\nThis is a future powered by AI. Not as a replacement for your voice but as an extension of it. A collaborator, tuned to your style, your instincts, and your aesthetic, moving at the speed of thought to unlock dimensions of your creativity you’ve yet to explore.\n\nImagine a world where design is not bound by repetition or delay, but one where you can iterate endlessly, choosing only what matters most. Where every artist has the power to refine their craft in seconds, turning sparks of inspiration into fully realized visions without compromise.\n\nWe believe design is the art form of our age. And every sketch is the beginning of a legacy—yours to shape. Together, let’s create tools that not only accelerate your process, but expand what you believe is possible.\n\nThe future isn’t waiting to be built. It’s sketching itself into existence, one idea at a time. **Let’s draw it together.**\n\n—\n\nWe are building Vizcom for designers like you. What is your dream tool? What features would accelerate your workflow? Drop us an email at contact \\[at\\] vizcom.co . We’d love to hear from you. Thank you for believing in us as a team, we promise to not disappoint you this year.\n\n— The Vizcom Team\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=cl_4i64ok&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)', html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'title': 'Our Mission', 'viewport': 'width=device-width', 'twitter:card': 'summary_large_image', 'ogTitle': 'Our Mission', 'og:type': 'website', 'og:url': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/blog/our-mission', 'ogDescription': 'As designers, we are storytellers.

Today, we are excited to continue this mission by enabling you to generate 3D geometry from a photo or drawing. This step forward makes 3D design more intuitive, enabling you to see your idea in a new dimension.\n\n3D models play an essential role of the design process, communicating scale, form, and materials that sketches often lack. They provide us with an understanding of how an object will feel rather than just how it looks. We're able to assess these models to make decisions, and determine how to move forward with a project.\n\nGiven the complexity of traditional CAD programs, creating 3D is not often part of the ideation process. Translating ideas from paper to 3D can be difficult, and takes a great deal of time to accurately capture the proportions and gesture of a sketch. This lengthy process discourages broad exploration, pushing designers towards early decision-making rather than expansive idea exploration.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/w9TpW9Hv61qvwL9w0Pol9E.png)\n\nIn Vizcom, your drawing acts as the foundation for generating a 3d model. Once your sketch is rendered, a 3D model can be created in a matter of seconds. By rapidly bridging dimensions, this feature offers immediate feedback on how an idea looks and feels from all angles.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/HS0odR8zVvUkSR3IRdFzAp1ns.jpg)\n\n3D can be generated from more than just a sketch. Capturing a well-lit prototype allows Vizcom to reconstruct the geometry and digitize your work.\n\nGenerating a 3D model is not the end of the iteration process inside of Vizcom. Models can be viewed as layers inside Vizcom, allowing you to use it as an underlay to continue sketching and generating new ideas.\n\nWe believe these new tools will change the way we design and develop ideas. With the ability to generate 3D from drawings, we hope designers will find themselves liberated to experiment more freely, push the boundaries of creativity, and achieve a deeper understanding of their concepts earlier in the process. This is only our first step into the world of generative 3D. We continue developing new technologies and tools that empower designers to imagine their ideas no matter the dimension.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, we will be rolling out this feature inside an updated drawing interface. We can't wait to see what you make with it.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=SO9gu3BiI&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'title': 'Bridging the Gap Between 2D and 3D - My Framer Site', 'og:title': 'Bridging the Gap Between 2D and 3D - My Framer Site', 'ogDescription': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.

You can list these keywords in order of importance to help shape the generated image. However, describing more complex designs can be challenging, as Vizcom doesn't interpret prompt context the way a human would. This means that assigning specific colors, materials, or features can sometimes be hit or miss. In such cases, using the selection tools can help you apply design elements more precisely.\n\nLet’s take a look at an example.\n\nSuppose you want to design a modern sneaker with multiple patches. You likely don’t want the colors and materials to appear randomly across the design.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/VQmQZIT91Vq23oOXuqVH1JNWd0.png)\n\nVizcom won't automatically know where each material should be applied without clear guidance:\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WMEh1T8hnyDtf0iOaOjVTh3uQA.png)\n\nTo gain more control over the design, start by describing the overall aesthetic of the shoe. Then, go step by step—selecting and describing each area individually to ensure precise results:\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Mo1v9kie8DV1n9Sxr9sVpr5fVGo.png)\n\nUse one of the selection tools from the menu—or combine several—to define the specific area you want to modify:\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/emHHhcaynTVUuTaxIheji3LyW1w.png)\n\nAfter generating within the selected area, the result is much more coherent—we're now able to control the placement of the patches on the shoe, instead of ending up with random or confusing distributions:\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/COmXWia64Pg2HGpsmWTEfGqwQ.png)\n\n[‹ Common prompt mistakes](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/common-prompt-mistakes)\n\n[How your sketches guide AI ›](https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/how-your-sketches-guide-ai)\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=Y0VgBpWmV&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'og:url': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/when-prompting-is-not-enough', 'og:title': 'When prompting is not enough - Vizcom', 'ogUrl': 'https://www.vizcom.ai/edu-prompting-guide/docs/when-prompting-is-not-enough', 'og:description': 'Vizcom turns your sketches into stunning concept drawings in seconds.

With Palettes, you can curate a private AI model that learns your aesthetic, giving you the power to generate with greater consistency, explore ideas faster, and ensure every concept feels true to how you’d do it.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/IjskMESmtUodT3gN5QyQl5AbxU.gif)\n\n### Authorship\n\nEvery world-changing idea starts with a sketch. But with many generative tools, **authorship gets lost**—images are created from words alone, disconnected from the hands that inspired them. From the beginning, Vizcom has taken a different approach: your sketch guides the design process, ensuring that the results stay true to your vision.\n\nPalettes take this one step further by learning your unique style to generate images that reflect your aesthetic. By rendering your sketches with your personalized Palette, you can visualize your ideas authentically—not as generic outputs, but as creations grounded in your sketch, your aesthetic, and your creative identity.\n\n### Curate. Generate. Iterate.\n\nPalettes are built to feel like an extension of your creative process. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Curate Your Style**: Upload 4–30 images that reflect a cohesive aesthetic. These might be your past work, brand visuals, or a particular style you’re exploring.\n\n   - Keep it focused: Smaller, more specific Palettes perform better than larger, mixed ones.\n\n   - Show it all: Include multiple angles or variations to help Vizcom learn the nuances of your designs.\n2. **Train Your Palette**: Upload your images to Vizcom’s Workbench, and in just minutes, your Palette is ready to use.\n\n3. **Sketch and Generate**: Test your Palette by varying the drawing influence percentage. At 100%, Vizcom closely follows your drawing. At lower levels, it leans into the aesthetic you’ve trained. This flexibility lets you explore a spectrum of ideas without losing your stylistic identity.\n\n4. **Iterate and Share**: Use your Palette across projects, or share it with your team to ensure everyone is working in the same visual language.\n\n\nThe video below guides you through creating your first Palette.\n\n### Creations:\n\nWe’ve been amazed by what designers have already created with Palettes during testing. Here are just a few ways Palettes are helping bring ideas to life.\n\nWe’ve been working closely with Scott Robertson as he’s trained numerous Palettes to capture his sketch style. This has allowed him to rapidly iterate on a variety of landscapes and environments, all while feeling authentic to his aesthetic.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/O7DKV7LGPeFVvjpb8mSEJtPMNTE.gif)\n\nTeam member Chris Ference has created a Palette called “Bone” that allows him to render his ideas in a consistent 3d shaded style. This allows him to begin his design process creating soft organic feeling objects.\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/clVUeQB4Gv2su21lxweWPYC5ls.png)\n\nPalettes are more than a feature—they represent a new way to create with Vizcom. By combining your sketches with a personalized Palette, you’re not just generating images; you’re shaping ideas that carry your style, your voice, and your vision.\n\nWe believe that great design starts with authorship. Palettes put the power back in your hands, helping you create with consistency, authenticity, and speed. Whether you're refining your own style, aligning a team around a shared aesthetic, or exploring entirely new concepts, Palettes ensure your creative process feels intuitive and uniquely yours.\n\nWe’re excited to see how you’ll use Palettes to push the boundaries of your design work. Your ideas deserve to be seen—and now, they can be, just the way you imagined.\n\n[iframe](https://edit.framer.com/?framerSiteId=3e326915499184beab1bba7824b41116cf2f9ee548da32018ec9519b55e29a9b&nodeId=bXoUddrdT&source=www.vizcom.ai&features=%7B%22editorBarOnPageEditing%22%3Afalse%7D)", html=None, rawHtml=None, links=None, extract=None, json=None, screenshot=None, metadata={'ogImage': 'https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3zqMY2ZSgXW5xGkWNjkzPQWEVU.png', 'og:title': 'Introducing Palettes - My Framer Site', 'twitter:card': 'summary_large_image', 'twitter:description': "Dive into Vizcom's blog for the latest insights, tips, and updates on AI in design.
