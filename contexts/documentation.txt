            "answer": "Paid Users: No, we cannot see or access your uploads or generated images.

We ensure the security of uploaded and generated content using robust encryption and strict access controls, adhering to SOC 2 compliance standards. This includes those trialing a paid plan.\n\nFree Users: Yes, your uploads and generated images are visible to Vizcom, as Vizcom retains the right to use your user content and designs for operating, promoting, and improving Vizcom."

            "question": "Does Vizcom use my uploads and generated images?",
            "answer": "Free Users: If you are on the Vizcom Starter plan, you retain full ownership of your uploads and generated designs. However, by using the service you grant Vizcom a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to use your user content and designs to operate, promote, and improve Vizcom; this license terminates if you delete your content or your account.\n\nPaid Users: If you subscribe to Vizcom Professional, Organization, or Enterprise, you retain full ownership of both your uploads and generated designs. You grant Vizcom only a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license strictly to deliver those paid services. This limited license does not grant Vizcom any broader rights to use or distribute your content.\n\nThis policy applies equally to users trialing a paid plan."

            "question": "What happens if I downgrade?",
            "answer": "If you don’t want to continue with your current subscription, you can always downgrade to a different plan.\n\nYes, the Starter plan is our free version of Vizcom. It offers all of the amazing features of Vizcom you need to get started, but you are limited to one Editor role, one Admin role, and one Team.\n\nThe Starter plan is limited to only two paid seats, either Admin or Editor. If you have more user roles than this prior to downgrading, we will downgrade the excess role types to Viewers. The Admin that requests the downgrade will remain an Admin. Admins can always change the roles of their Workspace members in their Workspace settings page.\n\nThe Starter and Professional plans are limited to one Team. If you downgrade from our Organization plan, all Teams besides your All-Workspace team will be archived. You will have view-only access to the files and folders in these archived teams. You will not be able to create new files in any teams other than the default All-Workspace team. You can move the location of your files from one Team to another at any point, as you see fit.\n\nSee our FAQ section for specific questions regarding content ownership and licensing when downgrading."
